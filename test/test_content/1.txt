   MY WIFE
   FORGOTTEN MASTER OF THE
   MACABRE— H.B. GREGORY
   There are any number of books that get touted as“rare” or scarce”; words that get tossed around far more often than is seemly. Among knowledgeable booksellers, the definitions are quite a bit different from what you might expect… “Rare” would be a book that a resourceful bookseller or collector might see once every ten years or so. “Scarce”, now there’s a word that if used correctly signifies something very special indeed… A book that a resourceful collector with a huge list of contacts with similar interests and a great deal of expertise may see only once in a lifetime! The books that often get described with these terms are usually just “uncommon” or as is more often the case, “expensive”.
   The original edition of this novel is genuinely“scarce”; whereas something like Lovecraft’sThe Outsider& Others is merely“uncommon” and most certainly “expensive”. Just as an aside, to demonstrate the point that Arkham House titles don’t qualify for the “rare” or “scarce” designation, I used to have a standing wager with friends that if they gave me a blank check to work with I could put together a complete set of Arkham House books within thirty days (and that was pre-internet!) Conversely, if one attempts to assemble “The Wagner List” we’re looking at a much more difficult feat, (some would say impossible, thanks in large measure to H.B. Gregory’sDark Sanctuary.)
   My colleague Dwayne Olson discusses the Wagner List in the article that follows, and was originally used as the introduction to the Midnight House edition ofDark Sanctuary.However, in the decade since several events have occurred which allows me to cast some additional light on just how scarce the first edition ofDark Sanctuary really is… To start with, in 2005 I received an e-mail from Harry Gregory’s daughter! As it turns out, the Gregorys were delighted to see a new edition of the novel and while quite elderly, Harry Gregory was still sharp as a tack and had very clear memories of his foray into supernatural fiction. He wasgracious enough to grant an interview, (originally published in Allen Kozsowski’s wonderful magazineInhuman,and reprinted here as an afterword.)
   The genesis of the novel was in large part an answer to H.P. Lovecraft and his penchant for“indescribable, unspeakable horrors”, eschewing the idea that the menace is more terrifying if left entirely to the imagination, Gregory shows us the demoniacal entity and still manages to maintain the mystique and impart a genuine feeling of dread. No mean feat, as I can tell you as a writer who has used both extremes that what I leave to your imagination is bound to be far more terrifying than what I describe on the printed page. It takes exceptional control and very precise prose to fully describe a monster and do so effectively. Some examples that come to mind are Long’s “Second Night Out”, Brennan’s “Slime”, and Leiber’s “Smoke Ghost”. That puts H.B. Gregory in pretty illustrious company, quite an achievement for a first novelist with no previous experience in writing weird fiction.
   The setting of the Gregory’s honeymoon proved influential in the development of the novel; but I’ll not say too much more on that for fear of stealing Harry’s thunder in the interview that follows the novel. Suffice it to say, one of the books strengths is the strong sense of place that Gregory is able to infuse in his descriptions of Kestrel and Pentock, which are not quite as imaginary as his disclaimer would imply…
   A devout Christian, Gregory also dismisses the Lovecraftian view of an indifferent and amoral cosmos and makes his novel a very clear-cut struggle between Good and Evil. He does so without being trite or the slightest bit preachy, but there’s no doubt that the author subscribes to a belief that Evil is a very real force and can only be overcome by a powerful reliance on the forces of Good.
   There’s little doubt that had the book even marginal exposure it would have been lauded as a classic in the genre. What happened to the book and its subsequent resurrection is a bibliographic miracle, in itself almost so fantastic as seem the stuff of fiction.
   The publishing house of Rider was well-known for their books dealing with all aspects of theology and frequently delving into fiction, soDark Sanctuary was a natural. Unfortunately, the company also favored tiny print runs and only 400 copies of the book were produced. Four-hundred copies is generally still enough to ensure that a book achieves a certain immortality, as at least a handful of copies will fall into the hands of collectors, some of whom may correspond about it or even get reviews published.Dark Sanctuary wasn’t so lucky… According to the author only review copies and “Colonial pre-orders” had shipped when the Blitz began and the warehouse holding the rest of the copies (and many other books) was burned to the ground. The author recalls the publisher asking to borrow one of his two author copiesin pursuit of a foreign language sale… He never got it back…
   The number of papers that reviewed Rider publications can be counted on the fingers of two hands. The number of“Colonial pre-orders”, which would have included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India was likely about the same number. That a copy found its way into Karl Edward Wagner’s hands was little short of miraculous… One of my mentors in book collecting as well as editing, Karl told me a trick he’d learned for discovering interesting supernatural titles… (In fairness, I think Ramsey Campbell also commented on this, so I’ll give credit to both gentlemen). Obviously, if an author has written an interesting book, it behooves one to look into the rest of that author’s output. Karl applied the same logic topublishers,reasoning that if a publisher offered one supernatural thriller, they were likely to have published others… Then it was all down to finding other titles from the same time frame (when the same editorial staff was likely in place) and tracking down promising-sounding titles… (this last can’t always be relied on, as some great books have been cursed with awful titles,The Dumpling, anyone?)
   Armed with the knowledge that Rider had been home to Warrington Dawson’sThe Guardian Demons and Furze Morrish’sBridge over Dark Gods,on one of his many trips to England, Karl had his eye out for Rider titles and discovered a copy ofDark Sanctuary. The book so impressed Karl that he listed it as one of the thirteen best supernatural horror novels in his column inThe Twilight Zone, but frustratingly enough to collectors, very few were lucky enough to find a copy of their own. After all, it can reasonably be assumed that only about two-dozen copies were distributed and likely only about half of those have survived into the present. One such copy made its way onto the hands of D.H. Olson, who discusses the book and Rider& Co. in the article that follows.
   It so happened that when Dwayne mentioned the book to me, I was pretty much set on Midnight House just publishing short story collections, and wasn’t keen on deviating from a formula that had been working very well, however, there was a new publisher who had just started up by publishing another fabulous rarity and was looking about for his next project… Dwayne had brought a Xerox ofDark Sanctuary to a convention where both the other publisher and myself were exhibiting our wares, so we approached the other publisher on the last day of the convention as he was disassembling his table and told him the story ofDark Sanctuary and offered him a xerox copy… Much to our surprise, he seemed unimpressed by the book’s story and to our shock left the Xerox on his table when he left… Then and there I decided that there were enough great “lost” supernatural novels to make it worth expanding the horizons of Midnight House and promptly published a new edition ofDark Sanctuary a couple of months later.
   Dark Sanctuary proved to be one of Midnight House’s best-selling titles and all of our copies have been gone for a number of years. However, two editions of this excellent novel still comprise less than 500 copies in circulation. That fact, taken with the new information about the novel available from no less than the book’s author makes the idea of a new edition quite compelling.
   It’s not often that a novel is published with so much editorial apparatus, (two introductions and an interview with the author), but I think that after reading it you’ll agree thatDark Sanctuary is a classic of the genre that merits such special treatment. For my own part, I’m honored to be able to do my bit to keep this amazing work alive.

   INTRODUCTION
   In 1983, T.E.D. Klein, editor ofRod Serling’s The Twilight Zone Magazine had a brilliant idea. He approached three of the best read people he knew, Thomas M. Disch, Karl Edward Wagner, and R.S. Hadji, to list, for Twilight Zone’s readership, some of their favorite“forgotten” works of fantasy and horror. The lists thus produced are some of the most amazing ever compiled. Published separately, those of Disch or Hadji would have been impressive by any standard. Yet, over time, they’ve been overshadowed by Karl Edward Wagner and his three lists of thirteen books each. “Why?” is debatable. Perhaps it was just the force of Karl’s personality. Or, maybe, it was something more intangible. Wagner’s thirty-nine books have since become legendary, drawing attention to writers who would otherwise have languished in obscurity, while simultaneously driving hard-core collectors into spasms of frustrated apoplexy. Part of this is undoubtedly due to the personality and acumen of the compiler, for Wagner, like Hadji and Disch, had a keen grasp of historical perspective and a sharp editorial bent. Wagner though, for whatever reasons, had a more unusual and eclectic vision than either of his co-selectors. He also, whether by accident or by design, produced lists that were ready-made for would-be bibliophiles.
   Of the thirty-nine books in the“Wagner list,” roughly one-third are easy to find, and even common — novels likeFrankenstein orPsycho. A second third are obscure, but still relatively findable, at least to anyone with connections in the rare book market. The real key to Wagner’s list however, the thing that made it memorable and its books worthy of desire by all true bibliophiles, was the incredible scarcity of the final thirteen or so books. To this day, collectors search in vain for such rarities as Alan Hyder’sVampires Overhead, or fantasize of finding books by obscure British authors like R.R. Ryan, Mark Hansom and Walter S. Masterman. At one time it had even been suggested that a few of Karl Wagner’s selections were not real books at all, but only titles made up to fool a gullible readership. An elaborate April Fools prank for bibliophiles. Of course, that wasnot the case. All of the books in Karl’s list were real, however rare and unavailable they might otherwise be.
   Among the rarest of those books wasDark Sanctuary by a certain H.B. Gregory. Exactly why this book should be so difficult is a question that may never be answered. The fact that its author never wrote another may have something to do with it. It may also have never been reprinted, unlike contemporaneous works by authors like Ryan and Hansom, whose work remains rare despite multiple editions. Then, of course, there’s the matter of time and place. London, 1939–1945, was not a healthy place for books. German fire-bombing raids clearly took a toll, especially along Paternoster Row where the offices ofDark Sanctuary’s publisher were located. Then there was the damage inflicted upon such books by the British public themselves: lending libraries went through books quickly and wartime paper-drives were a patriotic duty. Yet, for all of these,Dark Sanctuary’s biggest problem may have been its own publisher, for whom fiction was but a small sideline.

   William Rider& Son, later Rider& Co., appears to have begun life as a publishing house sometime in the first decade of the twentieth century. From the beginning their tastes were esoteric, to put it mildly. Primarily a publisher of non-fiction, Rider’s specialty were titles of an occult or metaphysical nature. Strange fact books by Eliot O’Donnell and parapsychological explorations by Hereward Carrington were two of their staples. Other typical releases included such titles as:The Mystery of Death, The Phenomenon of Astral Projection, Michael Juste’sThe White Brother; an Occult Autobiography, A Search in Secret India, andGhost Parade.
   But Rider, from its very beginning, was not content to limit itself solely to non-fiction. Deciding that its readership would occasionally like to relax with less“serious” books, they began to seek out fiction which shared plot elements or themes with their other publications. Some early examples of these were books by Bram Stoker and Marjorie Bowen, R.J. Lee’sAn Astral Bridegroom, and Mrs. Campbell Praed’sSoul of Nyria: The Memory of a Past Life in Ancient Rome. To better understand Rider’s editorial slant, andDark Sanctuary’s place in it, one need only compare it with other novels published by them at around the same time.
   By far, the most over the top of these, published just a few years afterDark Sanctuary, is Bridge Over Dark Godsby Furze Morrish. Part Gnostic/Theosophist Life of Jesus, it is also the tale of an eternal triangle between a Greek youth, a British slave girl, and the wife of the Roman Commandant of the garrisons in Palestine. Salome becomes an early Christian. Joseph of Arimathea is unmasked as a Zoroastrian sage. A youthful Jesus tours the world, honing his spiritual powers in secret Himalayan valleys and in hidden passages beneath the Pyramids of Giza. England is revealed as the future birthplace of one of the Seven Races of Man, its early church as a union of Christianity and Ceridwyn-worship. Pilate and friendly Romans plot to make Jesus King of Syrian. The Essenes are a branch of the White Brotherhood of Tibet and reincarnation an engine of spiritual atonement and reward. Toss in healthy doses of astrology, Lemuria, the mythology of the Watchers, Dualism, astral travel, elemental spirits, and Atlantean sex-cult survivals and one has a pretty good idea of the sort of subjects that Rider’s readers were most interested in. Perhaps most amazing of all, Morrish does all of this — and more! — in a slender one-hundred and sixty page book.
   Of course, the problem with most“idea” books, especially those written by true believers, is that they are seldom successful. In this,Bridge Over Dark Gods is no exception. While some of the ideas might be interesting on their own, or if developed properly, Morrish simply didn’t have the skills, or the perspective, to pull it off. In the end,Bridge Over Dark Gods is simply a huge muddle, readable only with difficulty by any but the most avid of what are now called New Agers. It’s only redeeming value, at least for fans of weird fiction, is a rather effective invocation of a powerful but mindless water elemental (Dagon) aboard a storm-wracked Phoenician cargo ship.
   A far more successful Rider title, and one that predatesDark Sanctuary by a dozen years, isThe Guardian Demons by American diplomat and novelist Warrington Dawson. It tells the story of Noel and Sibylla, an independently wealthy but high-strung southern couple who make the mistake of sitting in on an amateur séance. Exposed to such otherworldly forces, Sibylla finds herself haunted by two “Guardian Demons,” who inform her that they will remain with her until her death, upon which they will steal her soul. Noel, in an ill-fated attempt to save his wife, makes contact with Olive and Dr. Moyle, a shady spiritualist couple. The result is disaster for all. Sibylla dies and Noel, concerned for the safety of her eternal spirit, becomes more involved with Moyle’s spiritualistic explorations. Then a séance goes horribly awry and Moyle meets his end as well. Noel, an unconscious but powerful medium in his own right, succumbs to Olive’s influence and soon finds his life spiraling even more rapidly out of control, as even faked séances explode into riots of materializations and malevolent visitations. Finally, at rock-bottom and ready to end his life, Noel is saved by the very people who had inadvertently caused his problems in the first place. Their intervention brings him not just salvation, but the realization that Sibylla’s soul had never really been in jeopardy at all. It was, in fact, his own that had been in real danger.
   LikeBridge Over Dark Gods, The Guardian Demons is an idea novel. Unlike the former, however, it is a novel with a single message, which does not confuse or detract from the development of the tale’s plot. One may findDemons’ end trite or even anti-climatic, but it still retains a level of readability even to those who would discount the author’s message. For that message, while implicit within the plot structure, is only explicitly stated in the book’s closing pages.
   Dark Sanctuary, unlike most novels published by Rider, is hardly what one would call a message novel. Yet, it’s not all that far removed either. LikeThe Guardian Demons, or Bridge Over Dark Gods, it is imbued with a certain ethos from which it cannot be separated.
   The novel opens with Anthony Lovell, Sr., master of the ancient abbey of Kestrel and its like-named island off the Cornish coast, raving in madness and fear over the ancient family curse that“dwells in the bowels of the abbey rock.” What has caused his madness is unclear, but it is obviously linked to something seen or experienced in Kestrel’s ancient crypts. Lovell’s son is called back from London and, soon thereafter, John Hamilton, a free-lance journalist and friend to the younger Lovell, makes his way to Kestrel as well. Of the remaining plot, little more need be said in this context. Of theUniverse in which the plot is set, however, there are many observations that can be made.
   The first thing worth noting inDark Sanctuary is its use of a historical record to provide authenticity. The history of Kestrel given in chapter one is as fictitious as the abbey and island itself, but it includes just enough real historical data to be believable. Positioned as it is, early in the novel, it also has the benefit of pulling the reader into the story almost immediately.
   More important is the spiritual worldview against which the action is set, for when all is said and done,Dark Sanctuary is a veryChristian novel. By this, I mean not that Gregory is preachy in the way a Benson or Blackwood or Roger Pater can sometimes be, but rather that the author’s viewpoint includes both for proactive evil and for an equally active and far more powerful good. In this, and in its depiction of Kestrel’s true horror, Dark Sanctuary is actually very similar to both Adrian Ross’The Hole of the Pit and Eleanor Ingram’s much-neglectedThe Thing From the Lake.
   Still, being a Rider novel, there are also differences. When Ingram introduces supernatural intervention to the climax of her novel it seems slightly out of place, not least because a religious element is almost wholly lacking up until that point. Gregory does not make the same mistake. Partly that’s becauseDark Sanctuary is, from very early on, quite clearly the story of a struggle between good and evil; a conflict between the godly Michael Bennett, rector of St. Martins, and the worldly Dr. Grant, who would willingly free the demon trapped beneath the Abbey and send it out to ravage the world.
   The result is an unusual but very entertaining mix. Black Masses vie with Christian epiphanies. The belief in“a personal God” clashes with the ideal of “union with the Ultimate Reality.” Christian miracles are contrasted with the miracles of other beliefs and systems (“magic leads to egotism”… etc.). Nor is that all. Hauntings, astral bodies, elemental spirits, and the tri-part nature of manare referenced, as is the legendary Merlin, who has a role of his own in the Kestrel mystery. Even a smattering of theosophy makes its way into the mix. When Michael Bennett says, “Mr. Hamilton, when you reach my age you will learn never to scoff at other people’s beliefs, because those beliefsoften come to have a real existence, simply because they are believed in,” he is restating an idea that was not only used inBridge Over Dark Gods, but which also underlies a large amount of classic supernatural fiction, including at least two of Jack Mann’s “Gee’s” novels.
   Religious and philosophical elements notwithstanding, what makesDark Sanctuary worth reading is the power of its story. In classic pulp and weird mystery tradition, Gregory produces both solid heroes and solid villains, but he also throws in some twists and turns along the way. And, when the conflict veers into the cosmic, it becomes hard for the reader to predict how the plot will eventually play itself out.
   Sadly,Dark Sanctuary is H.B. Gregory’s only known book. Did the author, having produced the one novel which he had been impelled to write simply put down his pen and move on to other things? Was it the first novel of a career cut short and a life lost in World War II? We may never know. And while we can regret that the pen that brought us such a memorable place as the stormy, accursed isle of Kestrel never again put nib to paper, we can at least be thankful that its one creation is now back in print and ready to thrill new readers the way that it once thrilled a young aficionado of the obscure named Karl Edward Wagner. I think it is fair to say that Karl would be pleased by such a development.

   Chapter I
   I
   The doctor passed a weary hand over his eyes and looked down half incredulously at the still figure on the bed. It seemed almost impossible that less than half a minute before those white, silent lips had been screaming the most horrible words it had ever been the misfortune of a little country doctor to hear. Struggling to maintain his professional calm, he began methodically to dismantle the shining syringe from which that merciful oblivion had come. The two servants who stood watching looked at each other. The man spoke:
   “Will he be all right, Doctor?”
   “For the moment, yes.” He must not let these people see how bewildered and uncertain he was. “But his son must be sent for; he’s in London, I suppose?”
   “Yes, Doctor. I’ll send him a wire at once.”
   “Do.”
   Without another word the manservant went out. The woman made as if to follow him, but turned back to the doctor once more.
   “Doctor — is it — the curse?”
   “Don’t be ridiculous, my good woman!” There was nervous anger in his voice. “He’s had a bad shock, that’s all. Now go and rest. I don’t want another patient on my hands.”
   Obediently she turned and left him alone with the sick man. As soon as the door was shut behind her the doctor left the bedside and went to the narrow, mullioned casement.
   For a long time he stood there, gazing with unseeing eyes across the waste of grey, heaving water to the distant mainland coast. His thoughts ran round and round in his head like ferrets in a cage. The curse? Nonsense! He was a doctor— a man of science — nothing existed for him save that which he could see and touch, measure and analyse with his eyes and hands. This — this old wives’ tale — was the veriest nonsense: a bogey to frighten disobedient children with. And yet — here, on this lonely island, within the verywalls of the Abbey itself, things seemed not quite as they had seemed to him in his spotless, shining surgery but yesterday.
   He set his hands on the worn stone embrasure of the casement, and the contact brought him a brief, crushing vision of the enormous mass of masonry within which he stood: pier, wall, and buttress; arch, tower, and crenellated battlement— all imbued with that spirit of antiquity which makes man seem so ephemeral a creature. And this place, above all other, left with a legacy from that forgotten past beyond all human understanding — or so the legend ran.
   The dreadful screaming of the sick man, so lately silenced, still rang in his ears. What had been the words? A quotation, evidently from some book, thrown up by the subconscious in delirium.
   “During his lifetime, the curse, from a formless cloud of evil, grew into a monstrous thing having material shape, which at length overthrew his dominion and destroyed him. And now it dwells in the bowels of the abbey rock…”
   Fantastic, of course, albeit interesting folk-lore, no doubt, in its proper place. But the proper place emphatically was not here, on that very rock. The doctor strove to turn his mind from the subject, but the old man’s last cry beat remorselessly upon his unwilling memory:
   “It’s after me, Doctor! Save me! Save me!” And then such a scream as might have sickened Bedlam, until the drug cut it short in his throat.
   Bah! Nonsense! Since when have doctors taken seriously the delirious ravings of their patients? That way lay madness. With something of an effort he took his hands from the cold stone and turned from the window and the grateful light of day to the dim, vaulted chamber and his unconscious patient.
   II
   Young Anthony Lovell helped himself to one of his friend’s cigarettes with the air of a man making a great effort. John Hamilton smiled slightly as he watched him.
   “What’s the matter, Tony?” he asked. “Life getting you down?”
   “Oh, I’m bored, John, bored to tears. There’s nothing doing in London tonight.”
   “I can’t think why you stay here at all, Tony, when you could be at that superb place of yours in Cornwall.”
   “What, Kestrel? I loathe the place. It would suit you, John, but it’s too beastly lonely for me. Do you know, we only keep three servants at the Abbey — a housekeeper, her husband, and one maid. Three, mark you, to run a place which would take thirty to do the thing properly.”
   “But your father lives there.”
   “Well, he’s getting on, you know, and likes it, or says he does. Personally, I don’t think he’s any keener than I am; but it has a sort of fascination for him. Perhaps that’s why I keep away; it might grow on me too.”
   “And why not?” Hamilton leaned forward eagerly. “It’s not as if you kept any style here. You don’t use your Town house — ”
   “That mausoleum? Never. It won’t do, John; it simply will not do. You can’t bully me into living up to tradition. I’m quite satisfied with my life as it is.”
   “But I’m not! Can you give me the least reason for your existence? Oh, you’re a good fellow, and all that sort of thing, and amuse your own little set, no doubt. But that’s not enough. Either take your proper place here in Town, as your father’s heir, or go to Kestrel, and live as God meant you to.”
   Tony did not reply to his friend’s outburst, but sat staring at the glowing filaments of the electric fire, his forgotten cigarette sending up a steady tendril of smoke in the warm air. He looked oddly out of place, with his immaculate evening kit, in the workmanlike study of Hamilton’s flat. Behind him a desk, with typewriter and heap of manuscript, proclaimed its owner’s trade in unmistakable terms, although the near-by bookcase betrayed a poetic taste seemingly at variance with freelance journalism. The truth was that Hamilton, albeit a poet at heart, could not afford to give his art full rein, and eked out a very modest private income with the less romantic literary work.
   When the silence had become almost oppressive Hamilton spoke again:
   “Forgive me, Tony, if I said too much. But I’m your friend, and it hurts me to see you wasting Heaven-sent opportunities like this.”
   The other looked up with a start.
   “Sorry, old man. I was day-dreaming. Don’t apologize. Everything you said was true, and very much to the point. But don’t deceive yourself about our traditions: we have none — to be proud of. The Lovells have been either bad or indifferent since they first owned Kestrel. You’ve heard the tale, of course?”
   “Everyone has, more or less. A family curse, or something, wasn’t it? You don’t mean to say you believe in it, Tony?”
   “I don’t know. Sometimes I don’t, and sometimes — I wonder. Kestrel’s queer, John, very queer. You’ve never been there, have you?”
   “Once I saw it from the coast. I must say it impressed me then. That rocky island, with the Abbey crouching on its back, jutting so starkly from the sea. Rather grim, it looked, with the sun setting right behind it.”
   “And rather grim it is, John — sunset, sunrise, or high noon. We were never wanted there, and now we’re bound to it, whether we like or no.”
   “Tell me the story, Tony. But have another drink first.”
   Tony nodded, and his friend charged their empty glasses from the decanter at his elbow. Then he waited, watching that young face across the table, with its fine brow and delicate nose, marred only by a mouth ever so slightly irresolute, now set in an unwonted grimness as its owner marshaled his thoughts. Without looking at Hamilton he plunged into his tale.
   “About the middle of the thirteenth century an order of Cistercian monks settled on Kestrel, and built the Abbey. There is a rather peculiar legend in those parts that there had been a castle on the island before — the Wizard Merlin’s castle, to be exact, for it is said to be the last remnantof Lyonesse left above the sea.
   “Be that as it may, the good monks flourished for nearly three hundred years, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1532. Then Henry VIII presented it to one of his boon companions, the first Sir Anthony Lovell, my unfortunate ancestor.
   “He went along and rousted out the brethren with scant ceremony, and scantier respect for their cloth. There was, I believe, some pretty dirty work done — sacrilege, you know — one of the monks murdered at the altar. The Abbot was, rather naturally, annoyed, and, as was customary in those days, proceeded to curse Sir Anthony, going into the fullest details of how Kestrel would ruin him, and his family, body and soul.
   “At which Sir Anthony, never an easy-going fellow, from all accounts, killed the wretched Abbot on the spot. A general massacre began, from which only six of the monks escaped, by boat, to France.
   “I imagine that my tactless ancestor was rather shaken when he sobered up and realized what he’d done, but he was a tough nut, and didn’t care to show that he was badly frightened. He swore that it would take more than old-wives’ tales to scare him off his rightful property, and proceeded to adapt the Abbey to his own uses, fortifying it, and turning the chapel into a dining-hall.
   “Curse or no, he went from bad to worse, and some pretty unpleasant tales are told of the orgies which took place on Kestrel when he gathered his friends together.”
   At this point Hamilton, who had been following the narrative with close interest, interjected:
   “And how did he die?”
   Tony looked at him oddly.
   “No one knows,” he said slowly. “He disappeared one day, after a particularly violent drinking bout. It was thought that he must have gone on to the western battlements, which are sheer above the sea, and fallen off; still stupid with drink, and unable to save himself. Naturally, there are other legends, but they are too fantastic to take seriously.”
   “What sort of legends?” Hamilton insisted.
   “Oh, some rot about the curse materializing in the shape of a ghastly monster, and carrying him away.”
   “I see. Who succeeded him?”
   “His son, James Lovell. Quite a different type: no hearty, hard-living, hard-drinking bully like his father, but a lean, cruel-lipped ferret of a man. Just what he did on Kestrel no one really knows, but there are dark hints of black magic, pacts with the devil, and that sort of bilge. They even go so far as to accuse him of stealing children from the mainland, for use at his satanic rites. I believe the country people would have burnt him at the stake if they could have got hold of him, but the island was too well fortified.
   “Finally, even his bosom friends deserted him, and he spent several weeks alone. Here again the legends go off the rails with their tale of the lurid glare that shone from the Abbey turrets in those days.
   “When his friends plucked up courage, and went back, they found him dead. He’d been dead quite a while, too, or else the natural process of decay had been unusually rapid…”
   Hamilton relit his pipe, which he had let go out in his absorption, and pushed the cigarette-box towards Tony. The younger man took one absently and lit it at Hamilton’s match. Then he went on:
   “James left no son, and the estate and title passed to one Thomas Lovell, his nephew, an undistinguished man, who slept — or failed to sleep — one night on the island, and then retired hurriedly to London. However, a few weeks before his death he went back, and died, quite quietly, in his bed.
   “Since then nothing of any great note has happened. There have been one or two bad hats, but no one really distinguished, either bad or good. Just nonentities; and yet the line still goes on. It’s amazing, really. Every one of us has died on Kestrel, I believe; either spending our last years there or just going back to die. My father has been there now for five years; he went after Mother died. I expect he’ll die there too, and so shall I, and so on…
   “It’s heart-breaking — a family so old. We should be great, and yet we do nothing, nothing at all, except keep Kestrel going. The shadow of that blasted island is always upon us, from the cradle to the grave.”
   He drank deeply, and lapsed into silence. Hamilton sat still, his lean, strong face very grave, his eyes closed. He seemed to see, as in a picture, that unhappy family passing like pale shadows through the unchanging halls of Kestrel; meek, bowing their necks beneath the yoke, living only that the dark and secret life of that great pile of stone might go on eternally— drawing its sustenance from them, and leaving empty husks of no account.
   His reverie was interrupted by a strangled cry from Tony, and he opened his eyes to see that the other had jumped up, and now stood grinding out the stub of his cigarette in the ash-tray.
   “No, by God, it shan’t go on!” he cried. “I am the last, and there shall be no more. I’ll never marry; there shall be no heir this time.” With something very like a sob he turned abruptly and strode to the window, pulling aside the curtains and staring into the dark.
   His friend did not move; he knew these moods. Gently he said:
   “There is a better way, Tony. Not by annihilation, and the ending of the line, but by a clean break. Take something up — politics, art, any mortal thing. When your father dies, sell Kestrel, or burn it to the ground. You could be great.”
   The other turned slowly.
   “Do you think so, John? Do you really think so? If only I could! If we could start again, here in London, among people, at the heart of the world, away from that damned rock!”
   For a moment his blue eyes blazed with enthusiasm, and the light from a neighbouring street lamp caught his hair, turning it to gold. Then the glory faded, his shoulders drooped, and his face took on its former dejected look.
   “No, John,” he said sadly, “it’s not possible. We’ve tried before; we’re done for now. Oh, give me another drink, I feel like hell!”
   He came slowly back to the fireside, his feet dragging, and slumped heavily into his chair. Hamilton poured out the requested drink, and returned to the charge with:“That seems to have been the attitude of all your people: defeatism, Tony. Be a man, lad; I know you’ve mettle in you. Show the world that all the Lovells aren’t quitters.”
   “God knows I’ve tried. But if you’ll help me, John, I’ll try again. What shall I do? I know nothing of art; politics bore me stiff.”
   “Then get a job. You’ve plenty of capital; get interested in some business.” Hamilton considered for a moment, then went on: “Wait — I’ve got it! The very thing — I’ve an uncle in Birmingham who wants a partner; he’s getting too old to carry on by himself. He’d be glad to have you — engineering. He has a branch in South Africa. Go out there, get away, make a career for yourself.”
   “But I don’t know anything about the job,” objected Tony.
   Hamilton laughed shortly.
   “You’ll learn,” said he, “if you’ve got any guts. You can manage men, that’s the big thing. You were house-captain at school, weren’t you?”
   “D’you think I could do it, John?”
   “You’ve got to do it. I’ll write him tonight — better still, let’s go down and see the old bird tomorrow. He’ll like you, Tony, I know it.”
   “If I can do this,” said Tony slowly, “it’ll be the end of Kestrel.”
   “Then the sooner the better. And when you’re a captain of industry, marry some nice girl, settle down out there, and forget the whole blasted business.”
   “By Jove, I believe you’re right, John. I’ll do it!”
   Tony was on his feet again, his dejection forgotten; and now Hamilton rose too. They gripped hands, and for an instant Tony’s excitement was stilled.
   “I’ll never forget this, John,” he whispered, “not so long as I live.”
   Hamilton looked deep into the resolute blue eyes, and his heart went out to his friend.
   Tony picked up his glass.
   “A toast,” he cried, “to Big Business, and to hell with Kestrel!”
   As their glasses clinked, like an echo came the trilling of a bell in the little hall outside.
   Hamilton put down his drink untasted, and with a muttered query went to the door. Tony stood waiting, an inexplicable shiver of apprehension running down his spine. From outside came a murmur of voices; then Hamilton reappeared, a buff envelope in his hand.
   “It’s your man, Johnston, Tony. A wire for you.”
   Tony took the telegram with fingers that refused to keep steady, and tore it open. As he read his mouth twisted a little, and he crumpled the form savagely.
   “From Kestrel,” he said, in a colourless voice; “my father is desperately ill and I must go down at once.”
   Chapter II
   It was close on 10:30 the next morning, and John Hamilton stood on the departure platform at Paddington taking leave of his friend through the window of a reserved compartment in the Cornish Express. For the tenth time he implored Tony to let him go with him, but the young man was adamant.
   “No, John,” he said. “I must see this through alone, or I shall never be able to look you in the face again.”
   Hamilton gave it up.
   “Well, have it your own way, then,” said he, “but if you do want me, or if there’s any mortal thing I can do, wire at once.”
   The guard’s whistle shrilled, the two friends exchanged a hasty handshake, and the train began to move ponderously away. Hamilton watched it until the last coach had disappeared round the bend, and then walked slowly out of the station, his brows knit in perplexity.
   Tony pulled up the window of his compartment, sat down, and lit a cigarette. Now that he had actually started, he found, somewhat to his surprise, that he felt almost cheerful. After the arrival of the fateful telegram he had been almost overwhelmed by the setback which Fate had dealt him. He had lain awake all night, imagining all sorts of horrors, but now he began to reason with himself.
   After all, this was but a momentary interruption. His father would soon be well again, and he could take up Hamilton’s plan where they had left it. Or if the worst happened, and the old man died, then indeed he could make a clean break and leave Kestrel for ever.
   The train drew out of the smoke of the Metropolis, and the spring sunshine fell through the window, warming him. He took out a book and settled down for the long journey.
   He was lunching when they reached Exeter, and soon afterwards fell asleep. The stop at Plymouth failed to rouse him, though he was vaguely conscious of the train rumbling over the Saltash Bridge a little later, and knew that he was in Cornwall. He was finally wakened by the attendant at a few minutes to four, and informed that they were approaching Truro, where he had to change.
   The local train was late, and it was nearly dark when he got out at Redruth. Lorrimer, the manservant from the Abbey, was waiting on the platform, and greeted him with anxious warmth, but not until his baggage had been stowed in the back of the elderly Buick, and they had started on the ten-mile drive to Pentock, did Tony ask how his father was.
   “Very bad, I’m sorry to say, Mr. Tony. He was taken ill yesterday morning, and the doctor is very worried. It was he that told us to send for you.”
   “What doctor?” Tony inquired. “Old Pellew, from the village?”
   “He’s a good man, Mr. Tony, and there wasn’t time to go any further.”
   “Does he say what’s the matter?”
   “He doesn’t rightly know, Mr. Tony. Some kind of stroke, he thinks.”
   “Stroke? Does he suggest why my father should have had a stroke? He’s always been so fit.”
   Lorrimer’s hands tightened on the wheel. He had been preparing himself all day for these questions, but now they were coming he felt at a loss for words. He was quite sure, in his own mind, what had been the cause of Sir Anthony’s “stroke,” but he was not prepared to tell Tony everything yet. He had known the young man well in the years before his master had come to Kestrel, for he and his wife had been on the staff of the great house in Berkeley Square then, and the memory did not encourage him to take Tony into his confidence. He did not wish to be laughed at, so he contented himself with saying:
   “He doesn’t know, Mr. Tony. He thinks perhaps some shock — ”
   “What sort of shock?”
   “I couldn’t say, sir. The Abbey’s a queer place, you know, Mr. Tony. Enough to get on anyone’s nerves.”
   “Does it get on your nerves, Lorrimer?”
   “Well, sir, I can’t say that it does, not to any extent; though there’s a queer feeling about the place sometimes. Not quite natural, as you might say.”
   Tony grunted; he knew quite well what the servant meant.
   “How is Mrs. Lorrimer standing it?” he asked.
   “She thinks as I do, Mr. Tony, that we shouldn’t bother our heads over such matters. We’re God-fearing people, and we don’t believe that any harm’ll come to us. Besides, we’ve our duty to Sir Anthony.”
   “My father is lucky to have you two. No local people would have stuck it for so long.”
   The other snorted:
   “They’re a poor lot, these Cornish folk, Mr. Tony. Superstitious, ignorant lot. The maid gave notice this morning, sir. At a time like this, too!”
   “Did she, begad? Why?”
   “Said she heard something. But I took no notice. Brought her over when we came across this morning. A good riddance, if you ask me, sir.”
   There was silence between them for a while, during which Tony turned these things over in his mind. He could smell the sea now, and knew they were nearing Pentock. The deep, narrow lane, with its high, furze-topped banks, white with the dust of the road, was a tunnel of light in the bright beams of their headlamps.
   The car came over the brow of a hill, and in the cleft below lay a few scattered lights. In front was the sea, a vast expanse of vague greyness. Tony stared out eagerly, but there was no moon, and Kestrel was invisible.
   The road became very steep and tortuous, and Lorrimer slowed until the car was going scarcely faster than walking pace. A cottage, lamplight glimmering from its window, slipped by; they were in a narrow street, bumping over cobbles. At a larger building, with glowing red blinds, and a swinging sign of the Three Fishermen, they stopped.
   Lorrimer got out and held the door of the car open for Tony.
   “I took the liberty of ordering a meal for you, Mr. Tony,” he said. “We have to wait for the tide before we can cross.”
   As they entered the bar the hum of conversation ceased abruptly, and the pair became the cynosure of all eyes. The landlord hurried forward, wiping his hands on the apron tied round his capacious paunch, and greeted them respectfully. He led Tony through the smoky atmosphere into the splendid solitude of the back parlour, where his wife was ready to serve a meal, which the young man found very welcome.
   The good woman, after briefly expressing her sorrow at Sir Anthony’s illness, lapsed into a strained silence from which Tony was unable to draw her.
   He was ensconced before the roaring fire, smoking a cigarette and finishing his beer, when Lorrimer reappeared with the announcement that the launch was now ready.
   They made their way to the dark, silent harbour, and down the slippery steps to the waiting boat. Tony was profoundly thankful for the electric torch which Lorrimer carried, for he was by no means used to this sort of thing; but at last he found himself safely aboard. The boatman, Tom Tregellis, a part-time servant at the Abbey, greeted him with a nod and an unintelligible murmur. The luggage had been brought from the car, and they cast off at once.
   The night was very calm, but black as pitch, and Tony wondered how Tregellis knew where the island lay; but he had made the trip so often that it was almost instinctive with him, and within twenty minutes the searchlight in the bows had picked up the narrow entrance to the tiny harbour, and the black bulk of the island was looming overhead.
   The launch scraped gently along the rock landing-stage. Lorrimer jumped out and helped Tony off the boat, leaving Tregellis to deal with the baggage at his leisure. Then began the breath-taking climb up the seemingly endless flight of worn stone stairs to the Abbey, and once more the torch proved indispensable.
   At last they reached the top, and Lorrimer unlocked a wicket in the enormous iron-studded door beneath the archway. Beyond this a courtyard separated the outer wall from the irregular mass of buildings which was the Abbey itself. When Tony heard the wicket clang to behind him he had a sudden wild feeling of panic, and his heart was hammering as they mounted the steps to the main door.
   Even as they reached this it was flung open, and Mrs. Lorrimer appeared on the threshold, framed in a flood of golden light. Tony found the relief almost overwhelming, and stood speechless for a moment, scarcely hearing her warm welcome.
   It was fully ten years since he had been in that place before, and he could scarcely believe it was the same. Then it had been a cold, empty barrack, peopled only by dust and echoes. Now it welcomed him with warmth and light. The great hall was lit by means of incandescent paraffin lamps, hung by brackets round the walls; and in the cavernous hearth a great fire of logs roared and spluttered. In front of the blaze a bearskin rug made an island of comfort on the stone floor. Round it stood easy chairs and a settee, from which a little grey-headed man got up and came towards him, hand outstretched.
   “This is Dr. Pellew, Mr. Tony,” said Mrs. Lorrimer. “He’s staying with us while Sir Anthony’s badly.”
   Tony took the bony hand.
   “It’s very good of you, Doctor,” said he. “How is my father now?”
   The doctor’s eyes slipped sideways from Tony’s face.
   “He’s resting quietly, Mr. Lovell,” he answered, “but he is very weak.”
   “Can I see him now?”
   “Of course. But you mustn’t stay too long. He must not be excited.”
   Lorrimer took Tony’s hat and coat, and he walked with the doctor towards the magnificent staircase which sprang from the far end of the hall to a gallery running across beneath the roof.
   “Your father has had a very severe shock, Mr. Lovell,” the doctor remarked as they climbed the stairs.
   “So Lorrimer told me. But what sort of shock, Doctor?”
   “I can’t say,” the other said shortly. “That happened before I was summoned.”
   Tony sensed the opposition and gave up the attack. At the top of the staircase the doctor turned to the right and led the way down the gallery, which stretched the entire breadth of the building. They passed a number of closed doors and stopped at another. Dr. Pellew looked sideways at Tony, and said:
   “Again I must warn you: no excitement, and no questions, please.”
   The young man nodded, and they went in.
   It was not a large room, but the solitary candle burning beside the great canopied bed made it seem enormous with its flickering shadows. The remains of a fire smouldered on the hearth.
   Sir Anthony Lovell lay motionless upon his back, his eyes half closed. His sparse grey hair was disordered, and the bones of his face showed sharply white through the tight-stretched, yellow skin. He looked pitifully old.
   Tony caught his breath and went swiftly to the bedside, heedless of the doctor’s warning hand.
   “Father!” he gasped.
   The grey head turned painfully towards him, and the dim eyes sought his face. There was a long silence, broken only by the soft rustle of the fire. Very slowly recognition crept into the empty eyes, the pupils of which showed like black pinpricks in the faded blue. A whisper, very faint and far-away, came from the pale lips:
   “Tony, my boy — I knew you’d come.”
   Then, in a moment, extinguishing that little spark of reason, black horror came welling up into his eyes, and the old man sat upright, his features dreadfully contorted, and a scream gathering on his lips.
   Tony felt himself pushed unceremoniously aside as the doctor sprang forward, a hypodermic needle glittering in his hand. There was a brief, futile struggle, and Sir Anthony sank back, breathing heavily.
   Without a word Dr. Pellew gripped Tony by the arm and led him out.
   In the gallery he paused, and carefully fitted the syringe into its case. Tony watched him, trembling from head to foot. At last he found words.
   “What is it, Doctor? What is it?”
   “I don’t know, my boy, and that’s the simple truth. When I came yesterday your father was practically insane; through sheer terror, I judged. If I had been much later he would have been either a dead man or a lunatic. He has been under the influence of a hypnotic drug ever since. The sight ofyou awakened his memory, and for a moment overcame the effect of the drug.”
   “But what can be done? Will he recover?”
   “I don’t know. I hope so. Frankly, I am at a loss. The obvious course is to get him away from here, but I dare not risk moving him. His heart has been badly strained, and it might well prove fatal.”
   “Oh, but it’s horrible! Something must be done.”
   “I know, my boy; I’m doing all I can. Now come downstairs and have a drink. Then we can talk this over quietly.”
   Tony suffered the doctor to lead him away, and when they were sitting before the fire once more he managed to get a grip on himself.
   The Lorrimers had retired to their own quarters, and he and the doctor were alone. The great hall, which so short a while before had seemed a haven of light and warmth, was now a place of menacing shadows, which the flaring lamps did nothing to disperse. Tony’s glass was empty before he spoke again. Now he said:
   “How long can this go on, Doctor?”
   “Not more than a week, I’m afraid. If I fail to administer the drug every twelve hours he will remember, and lose his reason; but I doubt if his heart will stand more than a dozen further injections.”
   “But there must be some other way!”
   “I only wish there were. But we cannot erase his memory.”
   Tony looked up sharply.
   “We can’t; you or I. But there are those who can.”
   “Hypnotism, you mean? No, Mr. Lovell; I may be an old man, and out of touch with modern thought, but I can’t believe that.”
   “At least we can try,” Tony insisted. “I cannot stand and see my father die without making some effort to prevent it.”
   “As you will,” the doctor shrugged. “But I must decline to be associated with the case if you call in a professional hypnotist.”
   “You’ll stay until he comes if I do?” Tony inquired anxiously.
   “Naturally. But not afterwards. I may be old-fashioned, but I will not work with a charlatan.”
   Tony stood up.
   “I’m sorry, Dr. Pellew,” he said, “but I see no other way. There’s a telegraph office at Portreath, isn’t there?”
   The doctor nodded gloomily, and Tony went on:
   “Very well, I shall send Tregellis across first thing in the morning with a wire to a friend of mine, asking him to send down the best man in town.”
   Chapter III
   I
   John Hamilton propped Tony’s wire against the coffee pot and lit his pipe thoughtfully, his eyes still on the brief message:
   Get best psychotherapist in London stop send him to Kestrel immediately stop Tony.
   His keen brain was rapidly filling in the gaps which Tony had left in that urgent appeal. He noted the careful use of“psychotherapist” instead of “psychiatrist,” and understood that Sir Anthony Lovell was suffering from no ordinary disease of the brain, but from a deep-seated malady of the soul. Remembering the strange tale which Tony had told him on their last evening together, he could guess that yet another member of the unhappy family had fallen under the influence, real or imaginary, of the alleged curse.
   At last he went to his telephone and rang up an acquaintance on the staff of one of the great“dailies” to which he himself contributed. This man covered medical subjects for his paper, and was able to supply an address in Harley Street.
   Taking a taxi thither, Hamilton soon found himself in the consulting-room of one of the greatest mind-doctors in Europe.
   He gave a brief outline of the case, so far as he was able, and showed Tony’s wire to the great man. The latter was manifestly interested, but regretted that he was unable to leave his practice at a moment’s notice. However, he advised Hamilton to consult a certain Dr. Nicholas Gaunt, at an address in Hampstead. This gentleman, he said, was a brilliant psychotherapist, though he was not at all well known and had no regular practice. He explained that Dr. Gaunt would see no one without a personal introduction, but promised to telephone, and prepare him for Hamilton’s visit.
   Half an hour later Hamilton was ringing the bell of a large, gloomy house overlooking the Heath.
   A manservant admitted him, led him to a sombre waiting-room, and took his card to the doctor.
   There was no fire in the room, and after ten minutes Hamilton began to feel both cold and impatient. He was, in fact, debating whether to retreat forthwith and try his luck elsewhere, when the servant reappeared, saying that the doctor would see him now. He was conducted across the hall and shown into a small, barely furnished study. Behind a desk sat Dr. Gaunt, writing. He looked up as Hamilton came in and smiled.
   “A thousand apologies for keeping you waiting, Mr. Hamilton. I have been on the telephone with our mutual friend, and he has told me all about you.”
   Hamilton’s vague annoyance was instantly swept away by the other’s overwhelming personality. He had a swift impression of a tall, lean figure; a pale, handsome face, crowned with dark, silver-streaked hair; and a pair of the most amazing eyes he had ever seen. He took the outstretched hand, and was surprised at the strength of the slim, delicate fingers which gripped his. Taking the chair which was offered him, he sat down, facing the doctor across the desk.
   “Now,” the latter went on, “let me hear all you know of the case, from your own lips.”
   For the second time that morning Hamilton related the history of the Lovells, telling what little he knew of Sir Anthony, and revealing his own intimate knowledge of Tony. While he talked Dr. Gaunt’s piercing grey eyes never left his face. When he had done the doctor said:
   “Excellent, Mr. Hamilton. You tell your story well. A writer by profession, are you not? I have read some of your work with profound admiration.”
   Hamilton murmured a polite disclaimer, and the other continued:
   “I have formed my own opinion of the case already. I imagine that, as in the case of your young friend, this ancient tale of the family curse has gradually taken possession of Sir Anthony’s mind, until now at last, possibly by some mischance or accident, it has suddenly developed into an overwhelming obsession, and put his health, if not his very life, in jeopardy. You could not have done better than to come to me, though I speak with all humility, for I have had much experience of these complexes, and their treatment. I shall be delighted to take up the case. Exactly where is this” —he referred to the telegram before him — “this Kestrel, and how may I reach it?”
   “It’s not too easy to get at, in the ordinary way, Doctor,” Hamilton told him. “It’s an island, a couple of miles off the north coast of Cornwall, and the nearest inhabited spot is a little fishing village called Pentock, half-way between Portreath and St. Agnes’s Head — quite off themap. But I’ll wire Tony you’re coming, and he’ll meet you with the car at Redruth. You can get that far by train.”
   Gaunt smiled.
   “It sounds most intriguing. I like unusual places, don’t you, Mr. Hamilton? I will go down tomorrow.”
   When the details had been settled Hamilton departed, going at once to wire Tony. He was highly delighted with the success of his mission, and much impressed by the doctor.
   The latter, when his visitor had gone, made his way to another room, very different from those which Hamilton had seen: a large, comfortable room, lined with packed bookshelves and littered with strange apparatus.
   In the centre stood a long table, pinned to which was a great sheet of parchment, on which a man was tracing an intricate diagram in coloured inks. He was short, and immensely fat, with a massive, hairless head, which he turned slowly in Gaunt’s direction.
   “Well?” he asked, his thick lips scarcely moving.
   The doctor came up to the table, rubbing his hands together.
   “Very well, Simon,” he replied with a chuckle. “You have heard, no doubt, of Kestrel Isle, and the accursed family of Lovell?”
   “Who has not amongst us?”
   “I am invited to go there, to attend Sir Anthony Lovell in my professional capacity.”
   “What?” The other was on his feet, his lethargy gone, his narrow eyes wide open, his loose mouth working with excitement.
   “Exactly!” smiled the doctor. “This may well be the opportunity for which we have waited centuries. If it is so, then the tide has turned at last.”
   “You — you will take me with you, Doctor?”
   “Not yet. I shall go alone, and — er —treat Sir Anthony. When the first step is taken I will send for you. As you know, in spite of everything, not one of us has set foot on the island for nearly four hundred years. The conditions may not be altogether favourable— at first. I go tomorrow; meanwhile, prepare such things as I shall need. See to it.”
   “Very well, Doctor.”
   As Gaunt went out the other stared after him, gripping the table-top with both hands. His heavy body was shaking like a jelly. Sinking to his knees, he buried his face in his hands.
   “O Lord,” he whispered, “let it be so, even as we hope. Thy Kingdom come… Thy Kingdom come…
   II
   After Tom Tregellis had left for the mainland with his wire to Hamilton, Tony spent a restless day. He had breakfast and luncheon with Dr. Pellew, but since that gentleman did not seem disposed to stir from the fireside, nor to discuss the vexed question of Sir Anthony’s illness, Tony passed the time refreshing his knowledge of the geography of the Abbey, and of the island generally.
   The latter was roughly triangular, being perhaps a quarter of a mile across at its widest point. The south-western apex rose to a height of four or five hundred feet above the sea, and on this, the highest point, the Abbey was built, its grey walls merging with the perpendicular cliffs on two sides. Here the granite was naked, but on the opposite side of the island, facing the mainland, the ground fell away steeply, forming a depression, filled with a riot of gorse and coarse grass. At the foot of the low cliff at this point was a narrow beach of sand and shingle, terminated beneath the Abbey by a wall protecting the tiny harbour, whose other sides were formed from the natural rock.
   A device, similar to that found at Polperro, had been adopted to close completely the narrow harbour-mouth in the event of severe storms. Slots were cut in the rock on one side and the wall on the other, and a water-gate, made of great baulks of timber, could be lowered across the channel.
   From the harbour a steep rock stairway zigzagged up the face of the cliff to the one gate in the massive outer wall, which, quite bare and windowless, completely surrounded the Abbey buildings.
   The Abbey itself was extremely severe in design, and looked far more like a fortress than its name implied. Indeed, the original structure had been much modified by the early Lovells, whose minds had turned to more war-like purposes than had those of the monks who first built it. The main building was a rough oblong, with a square tower at either end. Narrow, slit-like windows, over-shadowed by the outer wall, accounted for the perpetual gloom of the ground floor.
   Tony, muffled to the eyes against the bitter wind, was pacing along a narrow walk within the parapet of the courtyard wall. What strange whim, he wondered, had possessed those old monks to build their home in such a place? Perhaps an act of defiance against the inhuman, godless sea which beat ceaselessly upon it; perhaps a great act of devotion to the God of all things and all places. Had they felt nearer to Him here than in the restless haunts of men? If solitude had been their wish, they had it here.
   He leaned against the crenellated battlement and gazed over the sea to the mainland, where, less than three miles away, he could make out the tiny village of Pentock, clear in the pale sunlight. It looked so near! It was near, and yet, in truth, how far away! This place was a little world apart.
   Difficult as it was to understand the monks first building the Abbey, how much more difficult to understand why his ancestors had remained here at all, once they had robbed it of its treasures! Yet he could not deny its fascination. Far off in London, he had cursed it, vowing never to return; but now that he was brought back against his will he felt quite at home, ready to stay indefinitely, letting the world slip by unheeded. And this in spite of the unhappy circumstances of his return, and the dark mystery which overshadowed all.
   Tony’s thoughts took a gloomier turn, and he found himself bitterly regretting the estrangement which had come between himself and his father when, after his wife’s death, the old man had closed their London home and retired to the solitude of Kestrel. That was five years ago, and now his father might never know him again.
   He fell once more to wondering what it could have been that had terrified the old man so that his very reason was tottering. Was it only some dark imagining, bred of loneliness and superstition, or was there indeed some abominable thing hidden away in that great pile of stone? Tony shivered, and, since the sunlight was fading from the sea, made his way down the spiral stair in the gateway turret and back to the fire in the great hall.
   There he found Dr. Pellew asleep in an armchair beside the blaze, and, not wishing to disturb him, he crept silently away and, going down the passage beyond the great staircase, found his way to the kitchen. He knocked on the door, entered, and asked the surprised and embarrassed Lorrimers if he might join them.
   Mrs. Lorrimer gave him a chair beside the great range, nervously dusting the seat before he sat down, and then bustled off, saying she would make some tea. Her husband stood awkwardly until Tony besought him to be seated, when he perched himself on the edge of a sofa near by. Tony was well aware that his unconventional intrusion had made the two servants feel most uncomfortable, but he was determined to find out more about his father’s illness, and this seemed the best way. He began by asking how his father had spent his time on the island.
   “Sir Anthony lived very quiet, Mr. Tony,” Lorrimer replied; “he only used the hall and the library, and his own room; everywhere else is locked up.”
   “I see. I suppose you and your wife have rooms over here?”
   “Yes, sir, we’ve our own stairs. The maid slept in a little room next ours. Tregellis is staying there now that we’re short-handed; he’s a useful man to have about the place.”
   “So I should imagine. I suppose my father spent most of his time indoors?”
   “Yes, Mr. Tony. He used the library a good deal, reading and such. He’d go out now and again, when the weather was fair, and walk round the courtyard, or maybe down to the beach. And every Sunday Tom would take him across to church. He was friendly with Mr. Bennett, the rector, and he’d oftenstay to lunch with him. He scarce went anywhere else.”
   At this point Mrs. Lorrimer appeared with the tea, and when each had a steaming cup in his hands the first feeling of restraint passed off to some extent. Lorrimer began to wriggle in his seat, and at last, after clearing his throat noisily, he blurted out:
   “I know what you want to know, sir, and I think you should be told — No, my dear, don’t interrupt” — this to his wife, who had turned sharply towards him — “ ’tis only right that Mr. Tony should know the truth. You won’t laugh at me, though, will you, sir? That’s all I’ve beenafraid of.”
   Tony assured him that he had never felt less inclined for mirth, and the old servant began his tale.
   “It’d be about a week ago, sir, that Sir Anthony first asked for a lantern. Said he was going down into the crypt to have a look round. I wanted to go with him, but he wouldn’t have it. ‘Give me a lantern, Lorrimer,’ he says, ‘and don’t argue!’ So I finds him one, and down he goes. The entrance is under one of the flagstones in the hall, you know, sir, back of the staircase.
   “He was gone about an hour, sir, and when he came up he looked a bit pale, I thought, and asked for a drink. But he said nothing. The next two days he went down again, sir; once he was gone for nearly two hours, and the missus and me got the wind up a bit, but he came back all right, looking white as a sheet, and trembling he was. I asked him straight then what he’d been up to, but he wouldn’t say. So I begged him not to go again. ‘There are some things as we’re not meant to know,’ I told him. He looked at me queerly, and said, ‘Lorrimer, you may be right. I’ll think about it.’ But that self-same night it happened, sir.”
   “What happened?” Tony leant forward, gripped by a horrible excitement.
   “Now don’t upset yourself, Mr. Tony,” Mrs. Lorrimer interjected, “or I shan’t let James tell you any more.”
   “All right! But go on, man!” Tony’s throat was so dry he could scarcely speak.
   “Well, you see, sir, before this Sir Anthony had only gone down in the daytime; this time he went at night. Perhaps that made a difference. Anyway, about three in the morning the missus woke me. ‘What’s that?’ she says. I listens. Then I hears it too. Somebody screaming, a long way off. Now, I’m no coward, Mr. Tony, as Missus’ll bear me out, but I didn’t want to leave my bed that night. But I told myself that God wouldn’t let no harm come to me; so I gets up, puts on my dressing-gown, takes my torch and a poker and goes to see what’s the matter.”
   “That was a brave thing to do, Lorrimer.”
   “Well, Mr. Tony, you see, I knew your father was in trouble — there was no one else to scream — at least, I hoped not — and I couldn’t fail him, could I? Well, when I got to the hall I found him. Lying beside the way to the crypt he was, in a dead faint. The trap was open, Mr. Tony, so I shut it quick and bolted it.”
   “Why did you do that, Lorrimer?” Tony strove heroically to keep his voice steady.
   The other hesitated, then he swallowed, and replied in a low voice:
   “As God’s my witness, Mr. Tony, there was something down there. I don’t know what, and I hope I never shall.”
   “Did you see anything?”
   “No, it was pitch black. But I heard it, Mr. Tony. Breathing, it was. Panting, as you might say, like a beast after the chase.”
   “Good God!”
   “Yes, Mr. Tony, and I reckon He’s about the only one as can help us in this. Then I picks up Sir Anthony — he’s not a heavy man, but if he’d weighed twenty stone I don’t believe I’d’ve noticed it then — and I carried him back to this kitchen, where the missus was waiting for me. We got him up to our own bed, Mr. Tony, and after a bit he came to. It was awful, sir — awful it was. He kept crying out thatIt was after him, and other things which I won’t repeat, if you’ll excuse me, sir.
   “We thought his mind’d go, and we didn’t know what to do, so we kept on giving him neat brandy. He drank it down as if it was water, and with no more effect, seemingly, till all of a sudden, when the bottle was nigh empty, he went under. Dead drunk, sir, and the best thing that could’ve happened, for he lay like that for hours, and we were able to get hold of Dr. Pellew. Now you know it all, sir. We hadn’t meant to tell you, but with you coming to us, so friendly like, we couldn’t keep it from you any longer, could we, Missus?”
   “No, James,” his wife replied, “you’re right there. Mr. Tony had got to know sooner or later. But don’t take it too hard, sir. James may have imagined a lot of it; I never heard or saw anything. And even if it is all true, we must trust in God, mustn’t we, sir?”
   “Yes — I suppose that’s all we can do, Mrs. Lorrimer. You have both been marvelous. How you can stay on after all that is beyond me.”
   “We’ve our duty to Sir Anthony, sir, and to you. We’ve been in his service nigh on twenty years. And we’ve our faith.”
   “The maid left at once, I suppose?”
   “Yes, Mr. Tony. She slept through the first part of the commotion, but she heard Sir Anthony crying out in our room afterwards, and that finished her. Just packed her bags and went. Feckless hussy!”
   A bell jangled over their heads, and Lorrimer stood up.
   “That’ll be Tregellis, Mr. Tony,” said he, “back from Portreath.”
   A few minutes later Tony was reading Hamilton’s wire announcing the coming of Dr. Nicholas Gaunt on the following day.
   Chapter IV
   I
   Tony was walking up and down the platform at Redruth, smoking a cigarette, and wondering what manner of man this Dr. Gaunt would turn out to be. Dr. Pellew had never heard of him, but then Dr. Pellew himself confessed that he was not in touch with modern psychology. Tony knew that he could rely on Hamilton to do his best, but he was rather doubtful about the outcome of this forlorn hope.
   His conjectures were presently interrupted by the distant rumble of the train, and he ceased his perambulations and stood beneath a lamp. The engine roared by in a flurry of steam, the brakes screamed harshly, and the train came to a grinding standstill. A number of people descended, amongst whom was a tall, thin figure in a dark overcoat, who glanced up and down the platform uncertainly. Seeing Tony obviously waiting, he approached, hat in hand, and asked if he had the pleasure of addressing Mr. Anthony Lovell. Tony acknowledged his identity, and the doctor introduced himself. Gripping the firm, cool hand held out to him, and gazing into those wonderful eyes, Tony felt all his doubts vanish. If this man could not cure his father, he told himself, no one could.
   The doctor’s luggage was collected with the help of a porter and bestowed in the waiting car. Tony took the wheel, and soon they were threading their way out of the narrow streets of the straggling industrial town into the dusky lanes leading to the coast.
   The doctor had expressed a wish to see the patient before discussing the case, in order that he might not form any preconceived opinions, so they conversed on general topics during the drive. Tony found his first impression confirmed at every point, for Dr. Gaunt’s conversation was both charming and exceedingly well informed; and by the time they reached Pentock the two were firm friends.
   They did not stop at the Three Fishermen for a meal, as Tony had done, for the doctor insisted that every moment was precious, and that he must see Sir Anthony as soon as possible. Tregellis was found in the bar, and sent down to prepare the boat; the car was put away, and in a very short time they were in the launch and heading for the island.
   Strange, Tony thought, as they climbed up to the Abbey, silently for very want of breath, how different this was from his first coming to Kestrel, two days ago. Then he had felt desolate, unhappy at the thought of his father’s strange affliction, oppressed by the dark threat of the fortress-like pile above them; a prisoner being led to his doom. Now he was confident, happy almost, secure in the genial comradeship of the man beside him, bringing hope and, he believed, salvation to this father.
   Lorrimer met them at the inner door, and respectfully welcomed the man who had come to save his master. His wife was hovering in the background, and, as soon as she was able, bore off the visitor to his room, smiling all over her homely features.
   As soon as Gaunt had disappeared up the staircase Dr. Pellew came out of the library, and listened gloomily to Tony’s panegyric of the newcomer’s virtues.
   “As I’ve said before, my boy,” he stated, “if anyone can do more for your father than I’ve done, he’s welcome to try, but for my part, I don’t believe it’s possible.”
   But when Gaunt reappeared, and Tony introduced the two doctors, he was secretly amused to note how Dr. Pellew’s hardly veiled animosity disappeared before the other’s tact and courtesy.
   “My dear sir,” Gaunt said, “you G.P.s are the backbone of our profession. Your general knowledge is profound. You yourself, for instance, could deal with hundreds of cases in which I should be worse than helpless. Obstetrics, for example, a subject of which I know practically nothing, whereasyou bring dozens of children safely into the world every year: a most admirable achievement. But in this realm of the mind strange cases occur once in a while, and that is where I and my fellow psycho-practitioners come in. We have the special knowledge necessary to deal with matters right outside ordinary medical practice.”
   Dr. Pellew, beaming with simple pleasure, replied:
   “You are perfectly right, Doctor. Never in all my experience have I seen a case like Sir Anthony’s. My villagers indulge in a variety of complaints, but their minds are too simple, bless ’em, to go astray as his has done.”
   After outlining his diagnosis and treatment of the case so far Dr. Pellew took his colleague up to see the patient, leaving Tony alone.
   Sir Anthony lay as he had done since his last outburst, the solitary candle by the bedside throwing his angular features into sharp relief. Gaunt approached, took the lean wrist, and felt his pulse. Then he peered narrowly into the half-closed eyes and shook his head. Motioning Dr. Pellew to accompany him, he left the room. Once outside, he said:
   “I can do nothing until the effect of your last injection has worn off. That will be at about noon tomorrow, will it not?”
   The other assented, and they went down the broad staircase to where Tony was anxiously waiting in the hall below.
   “There is absolutely nothing to worry about, Mr. Lovell,” Dr. Gaunt told him. “I cannot commence my treatment until Sir Anthony has recovered from the effects of the drug which Dr. Pellew has, quite rightly, been using. Tomorrow will be soon enough. Leave everything to me.”
   Shortly after dinner Dr. Pellew retired for the night, saying that he wished to leave the island early in the morning and return to his neglected practice at Pentock.
   “Not that anything urgent will have happened, you know, except possibly for a few cuts and bruises. I’m expecting no babies this month,” he said with a smile as he bade them good night.
   When he had gone Dr. Gaunt gave Tony his private opinion.
   “We must not delude ourselves, Mr. Lovell. Your father is desperately ill — in his mind. Admittedly Pellew’s treatment, the only possible one for a man of his limited knowledge, would have infallibly killed Sir Anthony within a few days. But the only real trouble lies in this mind. My first step will be to induce a state of hypnosis, when he will be quite safe for an indefinite period. Then I shall endeavour to find out what caused this abnormal state of terror, and afterwards, if necessary, erase it utterly from his memory.”
   “And you can do this, Doctor? You’re certain of it?”
   “Absolutely. I have treated many similar cases — some far worse than your father’s. Trust in me.”
   “I do, Doctor — without any hesitation.”
   They fell silent for a while, and Tony let his eyes wander round the great hall, with its lofty, timbered roof and stone walls, bare for the most part except for an occasional piece of arras, or a trophy of arms catching the light upon its polished steel. When his absent-minded gaze fell upon the staircase at the farther end he suddenly remembered the trap-door which lay beneath it, beside which his father had been found five days ago. Recalling the strange and dreadful story which Lorrimer had told, he at once began to wonder whether he should tell it to the doctor.
   The latter was sitting at his ease in a corner of the deep settee, which stood in front of the fire at right angles to the easy chair which Tony occupied. He was gazing at the glowing embers, apparently lost in reverie; his lean, hawk-like profile, firm lips, and level brows, beneath which the brilliant eyes were now half veiled, still as a bronze statue in the ruddy light.
   The young man broke the silence with:
   “Doctor, I’ve something to tell you.”
   “I’ve been waiting for it, Tony. I knew you had.”
   At the easy use of his Christian name Tony felt a queer little glow of warmth about his heart. Eagerly he plunged into the tale, repeating Lorrimer’s story almost word for word.
   Gaunt heard it through without comment, his long, sensitive fingers held tip to tip on his knee. Only when Tony had finished did he turn his head and regard him steadily.
   “So,” he said, “there is more in this than I at first suspected. Your father’s terror has infected his servant also. But we must not have you under its influence as well. Come, have you a torch?” He rose to his feet.
   Tony stood up slowly, trembling. The telling of the weird tale had reawakened all his slumbering fears.
   “Why, Doctor? What are you going to do?”
   “If you have a portable lamp of any kind you and I are going down into that crypt, and I am going to show you that there is nothing there to be afraid of.”
   “No, Doctor, no! I couldn’t — don’t ask me…!” Tony’s voice rose to a high note and his lips quivered.
   With one stride Gaunt was beside him, gripping both his hands.
   “Look into my eyes,” he commanded.
   Almost unwillingly Tony obeyed, and as his own faltering gaze met the doctor’s level stare the tide of panic which had threatened to overwhelm him sank and passed away. As if in a dream he heard the words:
   “Cast out fear. So that your soul be not afraid, there is no thing in Heaven or earth shall harm you.” And with the words, courage such as he had never known filled the young man’s heart, and without another word he turned to a heavy chest beside the fireplace and took out a small electric torch. He looked back at Gaunt, who nodded, and they crossed the stone flags together, passing under the great staircase.
   Here they paused beside one of the flagstones, which differed from the rest in that it had an iron ring at its centre and a bolt at its edge. Tony released the bolt and with a mighty heave swung the ponderous trap up on its pivot, revealing a square well of blackness. Taking his torch he flashed the beam downwards, lighting the top of a steep flight of spiral stairs. With just a little effort of will he began to descend, Gaunt following close behind.
   At the bottom of the steps they found themselves in a vaulted chamber, which stretched away far beyond the limits of the torch’s beam.
   “I’ve never been down here before,” Tony whispered. “Which way shall we go?”
   “Straight ahead, down that line of pillars,” Gaunt replied, in a voice so normal that Tony was almost shocked.
   They followed the direction which the doctor had suggested until they reached a wall of natural rock. This they followed round until they came to the foot of the staircase once more. Another circuit of the place convinced Tony that there was no other exit, and, since there was nothing to be seen save the bewildering lines of pillars supporting the low roof, looking for all the world like trees in a petrified forest, there was nothing for it but to return the way they had come.
   After he had lowered the trap into place Tony shot the bolt once more; but if Gaunt noticed the action he made no comment.
   When they were back beside the fire, consuming brandy-and-soda, which Tony, at least, felt that he had earned, the doctor spoke:
   “You see, Tony, there’s nothing down there to be afraid of.”
   “No, there certainly doesn’t seem to be. Was it all imagination, then? On both my father’s part and Lorrimer’s?”
   “Very probably. Remember, Lorrimersaw nothing. What he heard was probably the wind. It’s very calm tonight, but when it does blow I should imagine it makes itself heard.”
   “That’s very true, Doctor. In a high wind you can hardly hear yourself speak sometimes.”
   Soon afterwards they retired to their respective rooms.
   Had Tony not been sleeping soundly he might have heard Gaunt leave his room some three hours later and pass along the gallery outside. He might, but even that is doubtful, for the doctor was wearing felt-soled shoes, and moved with infinite caution. He carried a flash-lamp, with which he lit his way down the staircase, the stone treads of which must have rejoiced his heart, had he ever attempted to descend wooden steps in silence.
   It took him quite five minutes to raise the trap, so intent was he upon making no sound; but when it was open he wasted no more time, but passed swiftly down the spiral stairs and straight along the centre of the crypt. Half-way across he paused, consulted a pocket compass, and struck off towards the east. Twenty paces brought him to the place he was seeking, at a point which he and Tony had never touched in their perambulations round the walls. Here, in an open space, where one of the pillars would normally have been, stood a great oblong block of stone, raised upon three low steps. This was nothing less than the ancient crypt altar of the Abbey, and for a few moments Gaunt stood regarding it with satisfaction.
   Then he mounted the steps and shone his lamp upon its upper surface. As he did so he noticed a curious thing. The five small crosses which must have been incised upon it when it was consecrated had been carefully removed, leaving depressions in the stone. Nodding to himself, as if at the confirmation of some theory, he set his torch carefully on the step beside him and, seizing the edge of the single block of granite which formed the altar-top, heaved violently upwards. Nothing happened; and after some minutes of futile struggling he desisted and sat down on the upper step, wiping the sweat from his face, for it was very close in that silent place.
   After a while he got up and, taking his torch, began to go carefully round the edge of the slab. At a point on the back he stopped and inserted a probing finger. There was a sharp click, and he stood up with a faint sigh of satisfaction. Once more he essayed to lift the stone, and this time he was successful, for the entire altar-top swung upwards on a pivot, revealing a yawning cavity within.
   A rush of foul air blew in Gaunt’s face as he peered over the side, flashing his lamp within, but, apparently undismayed, he swung a leg over and lowered himself into the depths.
   Perhaps an hour passed before he reappeared, dripping with sweat and gasping for breath; but he was smiling as he gently lowered the counterbalanced slab into place.
   Tony did not hear the doctor go back to his room, for he was still asleep; and if Sir Anthony heard, he never told, though he lay awake staring at the canopy of his bed with drug-clouded eyes.
   When the grey dawn came creeping through the narrow, mullioned windows of Gaunt’s room the doctor was sleeping like a child, but on his lips there was still a smile, which, in the circumstances, was a curious thing.
   II
   A week later Hamilton received a long letter from Tony. It was post-marked Pentock, and ran thus:
   Kestrel,
   c/o P.O., Pentock,
   Cornwall.
   April 15th.

   My dear John,
   Thanks so much for finding Dr. Gaunt for me and sending him down here. He’s an awfully decent fellow, and we all like him immensely.
   The Lorrimers can’t do enough for him. He knows his job too; the improvement in Dad’s condition is simply amazing. As you must have gathered, he was in a pretty bad way when I came down here. The local G.P. — one of the best, if a trifle antique — couldn’t make him out at all. He’d had an awful shock, that was evident, and it threatened to send him off his rocker, so the beggar could think of nothing better to do than to dope him with some infernal concoction which would have killed him in a week. But Gaunt’s changed all that.
   He waited till the last dose had worn off and then he spent an hour with Dad, alone. I’ve no idea what he did, but when he fetched me, there was the old chap, sitting up in bed, still very weak, of course, but as sane as you or I, drinking beef-tea like a two-year-old, and as happy as can be.
   He’s getting up for a while tomorrow, and we expect he’ll be quite fit in another week at the outside.
   Of course, he doesn’t remember what happened to him; that’s part of Gaunt’s treatment — he’s washed out the memory somehow. But personally I don’t think that anything did happen, outside his own imagination.
   Lorrimer found him beside the entrance to the crypt, and I fancy he’d been poking round down there and lost his lamp or something, and then got the wind up and bolted. Gaunt thinks so too. We went down there the other night, and there’s nothing alarming at all. Bit creepy, of course, and I can well imagine Dad having a fit of the horrors, without a light.
   As for me, I’m feeling awfully fit, and seriously thinking of taking your advice and staying here. It’s a delightful spot, and in the summer it will be superb. You must come down for a week or two, John, or as long as you like. We could get as much bathing and fishing as you want.
   Gaunt’s staying on for a while until Dad’s quite fit.
   Do write and let me know if you can come, and when. How’s London looking? Pretty grim, I guess.Yours,Tony.
   Hamilton folded the letter with a smile. Dear old Tony! Never the same for two consecutive minutes. Now he’d forgotten all his fears, and was in love with his old nightmare!
   Not a bad idea, though, to go down and see him when the summer came. He sat down and wrote to his friend, telling him he’d come in a couple of months’ time. Holiday jaunts at a moment’s notice were not for hard-working fellows like himself, he thought. But he was glad Tony was happy again.
   Chapter V
   The weeks passed by, and life on Kestrel pursued its even tenor. Sir Anthony, restored to his former health and vigour, with all recollection of his terrible experience erased from the tablets of his memory, was very happy in the newly discovered companionship of his son, who found his own life beginning anew in the ancient home of his family.
   Dr. Gaunt was still with them, for Sir Anthony had taken a great fancy to the man who had saved his reason, if not his very life, and insisted that he must stay with him as a sort of resident physician. Tony was only too pleased with this arrangement, for the two were firm friends.
   They spent much of their time in the open, clambering about the island, bathing from the sheltered beach, fishing in the launch, and making occasional trips across to the mainland. And when outdoor activities began to pall they ransacked the library, and, in company with Sir Anthony, spent many an hour delving into that treasury of ancient learning. Gaunt’s knowledge of all subjects was profound, and in this, as in every occupation, he proved a delightful companion.
   Tony’s manservant, Johnston, had come down from London at his master’s bidding, and with this addition to their staff, as well as Tom Tregellis, the Lorrimers found they could serve the little party right royally.
   The Abbey itself seemed to respond to the happiness within its walls, whose very outlines appeared to soften their ancient grimness and put on a new coat of mellow beauty under the glorious sunshine of that early Cornish summer. The gulls flashed white about the rugged towers, dark against the flawless blue above, and the waves lapped gently at the foot of the tremendous cliffs.
   It was a happy time, and when stark tragedy came bursting in upon it the shock was all the greater.
   Gaunt and Tony had been out on a fishing expedition, and as they climbed the long stairway to the Abbey they were talking breathlessly of their day’s sport. Tony was just saying, “You should have seen the one that got away!” and the doctor was laughing at him, when Tom Tregellis burst out of the wicket in the great gate above him and came running headlong down the worn steps, shouting as he came:
   “Mr. Tony! Doctor! Come quick! The master…”
   He reached them babbling something incoherent about the library. Without waiting for further explanation they both began to run, Gaunt easily outstripping the younger man.
   When Tony came to the library, a long, low room beyond the great hall, he found the doctor bending over the crumpled figure of his father. Lorrimer was standing by the table, a blood-stained cloth in his hand, and his wife was near by, wringing her hands and weeping silently. An overturned step-ladder, and a heap of books, fallen from a gap in one of the upper shelves, told their own story.
   “Is he badly hurt, Doctor?” Tony gasped.
   Gaunt’s delicate fingers were exploring the dreadful bloody patch on the back of the grey head. He did not look up.
   “The skull is fractured; badly, I fear,” he said gravely. “He must have hit the table in falling. Come, help me get him upstairs.”
   Gently they carried the limp figure up the great staircase and laid him on his bed. Then the doctor asked for hot water, and, when it was brought, sent them all away while he worked.
   Tony went sadly down the stairs and back to the library, where he found Lorrimer gathering up the fallen books. The servant turned a piteous face to the young man.
   “I heard the crash, Mr. Tony, and came running, and there he lay, quite still, his poor head all bleeding and a book in his hand.”
   “What book?” Almost unconsciously the question came.
   Lorrimer took from the table a small volume, bound in decayed, tattered leather, and handed it to him. Tony opened it and saw a title-page, written in manuscript, the ink faded and brown with age:The Curse of the Lovels.
   He looked sharply at Lorrimer.
   “I’ve never seen this before,” he said.
   “No more have I, Mr. Tony.”
   Tony turned the stiff, mildewed pages. A passage caught his eye:
   then the abbott, raising his hands aloft, cried in a loud voice, saying:“Anthony Lovel, ere we leave this island home of ours for ever, we have a word for thee. At the bidding of thy profligate master, thou didst come hither to seize our treasures for the Crown, and, casting us out, to hold this island for thine own. If that were all, we yet might leave thee to the sure justice of high heaven, but that is not all, by far. Not content with forcing an entrance here, thou, and thy men-at-arms, didst slay remorselessly those brethren who did valiantly oppose their naked hands to thy keen swords and mail of proof. Their blood crieth out for vengeance, nor shall it cry it vain.
   “Nor is that the greatest of thine iniquities, for, finding the sub-prior before the altar, celebrating the Holy Mysteries, since he would not heed thine importunities, thou didst cut him down, and his blood floweth darkly in the sanctuary, mingling with the Most Precious Blood of Christ, spilledfrom the chalice in his nerveless grasp.
   “For this most awful sacrilege, hear then the doom of Holy Church, for we yet have power to bind, and loose, though Henry sits on England’s throne:
   “I, Stephen, mitred abbott of Kestrel Isle, do pronounce thee, Anthony Lovel, excommunicate and accursed, and this island under interdict.
   “Not thou alone, Anthony Lovel, shalt suffer for this day, but all thy cursed seed that follow after thee as lord of Kestrel shall feel the weight of our just vengeance, and see hell-gate yawn for them at the last.
   “And this little isle, which for so long has been the dwelling-place of God His servants, shall become an abode of demons, an ante-room of hell; foul fiends from the nether-most pit shall wander in this dark sanctuary; and no human head, least of all a Lovel’s, shall rest in peace upon this soil. Yet wilt thou dwell here, and thine heirs, never at peace, but bound by the iron chains of destiny.”
   At which saying, enraged beyond measure, Sir Anthony smote the abbott with his sword, and slew him, and so—
   Fascinated, Tony had not heard the door open, and shut the book quickly, almost in terror, as he heard Gaunt’s voice:
   “Tony, old boy, I am very sorry to have to tell you, but your father is dying. He is still unconscious, but he may be able to speak to you just before the last.”
   Lorrimer, standing near by, caught his breath and turned away. Tony said huskily:
   “When will that be, Doctor?”
   “Probably in a few hours’ time. It is a miracle that he is still alive, but nothing can save him. I will stay with him; you had better rest. I will call you if there is any change.”
   Tony nodded silently, and Gaunt went back to his patient. As the door closed behind him Tony spoke to Lorrimer.
   “You may go now. I shall be here if you want me.”
   The old servant went out with the tears he did not attempt to conceal trickling down his wrinkled cheeks.
   Tony sat down by the table and reopened the book. So far as he could make out in a perfunctory examination, it merely went on to tell, with a wealth of superfluous detail, the story of his family’s misfortunes, which he already knew too well. There was a passage concerning the infamous James Lovell which interested him, however:
   Then came James Lovel, nephew to Anthony. He had learned the black art in Florence in his youth, and was not dismayed, nay, was delighted even, by the evil which dwelt on Kestrel. It is said that he and his associates turned the ancient crypt into a pagan temple, and celebrated the blasphemous mysteries of the black mass on God’s altar there. Many helpless infants were stolen away from their cradles in that time, and perished at his hands, sacrifices to the Demon.
   During his lifetime, the curse, from a formless cloud of evil, grew into a monstrous thing having material shape, which at length overthrew his dominion, and destroyed him.
   And now it dwells in the bowels of the abbey rock, drawing its life from the accursed family which dwells there, until one shall be found strong enough to overcome it, and drive this monster from the fair face of earth.
   When the fading light at last rendered the crabbed writing illegible Tony closed the book and sat staring into the dusk.
   Was it true? he asked himself. Since his father’s recovery, and during the happy weeks they had spent together, the story of the curse had been relegated to the lumber-room at the back of his mind; but now it sprang out again, panoplied in all its hellish significance. Once more he asked himself the age-old question: can such things be?
   Presently Lorrimer came in and lit the lamp, but neither spoke, each respecting the other’s sorrow. Later Mrs. Lorrimer entered, her eyes red with weeping, and quietly set a tray, with sandwiches and decanter, on the table; but Tony could not eat, and only drank a little wine.
   The hours crept by and outside the wind began to rise, wailing mournfully in the chimneys and spattering drops of rain upon the glass. Upstairs a Lovell lay a-dying, and it seemed that all Kestrel wept for him.
   During those sad hours of waiting a great resolve was born in Tony’s heart. When his father died, and he himself was lord of Kestrel, he told himself that he would not rest until the ancient mystery was settled, once for all. Gaunt would help him, with his wide knowledge, which, once or twice during their friendship, had hinted at things not known to ordinary men.
   It there were nothing in the hidden parts of the Abbey but dust and shadows, and the unquiet wind, then the horrid fable must be exploded. It there were more— and Tony’s mind balked at the possibility — then it must be utterly cast out. For a moment he saw himself and Gaunt, like knights of old chivalry, clad in shining armour, riding out to fight the dragon. So the hours crept by.
   The pile of cigarette-ends and ash was overflowing the tray at Tony’s elbow when at last he heard a quick step outside, and the door opened. Gaunt, haggard and brilliant-eyed, stood on the threshold.
   “Come, Tony, he is going.”
   As if in a dream, Tony followed him along the passage to the hall, mounted the staircase, and passed down the gallery to his father’s room. He had a swift vision of the servants clustered around the door; then he was inside and on his knees by the great bed.
   The old man lay very still, his grey hair hidden by the swathing bandages, his eyes closed. He hardly seemed to breathe.
   Outside the wind howled like a soul in torment, and the rain lashed the window-panes.
   Tony watched his father’s face with breathless attention. Would he pass out so into the unknown, without a word? No, the pale lips parted with a little moan, and the eyelids fluttered. With something of a shock Tony found himself gazing into the faded blue eyes, full of intelligence, which were immediately fixed upon him. A thin hand crept out over the coverlet, and he caught it in his own warm grasp. Faintly, as from a great distance, came his father’s voice:
   “My boy. Don’t worry… everything is all right… I have remembered… the good doctor made me forget… but that book… in the library… I remembered again… everything went black… I suppose I fainted… and fell… Silly of me! But I’m not afraid any more… I’m going now… out of reach of that dark thing down there… in the crypt… the crypt, Tony… the altar… inside… steps… down… down… and then… the Thing! It is our responsibility, Tony… never forget that… ours. We brought it into the world… and we must keep it here… safe… away from everybody. Keep it… safe… safe…”
   His voice trailed away into silence. Tony’s face was only a few inches from his father’s, the amazing likeness of the two, one old, the other young, standing out with a significance almost awful.
   Gaunt stood at the foot of the bed, his hands gripping the posts on either side, trembling from head to foot. His eyes, glowing with a strange radiance of their own, were fixed on the old man with an intensity which was truly terrific. Small drops of sweat stood on his brow. Tony never looked at him.
   Suddenly Sir Anthony opened his eyes again, gripped his son’s hand with surprising strength, and sat up, staring full at Gaunt. Loud and strong his voice came:
   “Tony! I see it all — I see it now — the whole abominable thing. Beware! Beware of — But his voice was strangled in his throat, his free hand clawed the air, and he fell back in the last agony. He gave a great sigh, and his limbs relaxed. Gently Tony disengaged himself and folded the thin waxen hands on the still breast. Gaunt turned away with a sigh, which, in any other place, might have been taken for one of relief.
   At that moment the whole Abbey, from foundation stone to turret-top, quivered as if from a tremendous blow, and a dreadful yelling sound, deep-throated and inhuman, came bellowing up from some great depth below.
   Tony felt as though an icy hand had closed about his heart. White to the lips, he sprang up, crying:
   “In Heaven’s name, what was that?”
   But the doctor replied quietly:
   “Only the wind; the wind and the waves.”
   Chapter VI
   I
   The wretched business of the inquest was soon over, the coroner finding that Sir Anthony had died from misadventure, and on a beautiful June morning he was laid to rest in the family vault in the little churchyard on the hillside above Pentock.
   As Tony stood, bareheaded, by the door of the vault, listening to the voice of the old rector as he read the infinitely moving words of the Burial Service, he lifted his eyes and looked over the sea to where Kestrel lay, with the dark shape of the Abbey crouched upon its back.
   “He’s safe from you now,” he thought, but he knew that upon his own shoulders the burden of that ancient tyranny now rested, and, bowing his head, he accepted the responsibility.
   When it was all over, and the iron gates were shut upon all that was mortal of his father, the rector came to him and laid a hand upon the young man’s arm.
   “I knew your father, my boy,” he said, “and I hope to know you better. Never hesitate to come to me if you think I can be of any help. God be with you!”
   After the funeral Tony had to go up to London to see his solicitor, and to attend to many matters connected with the estate. He left Gaunt at Kestrel, for he had asked the doctor to stay on for a while, though he had not yet opened his heart to him on the matter of the curse.
   Curiously enough, it never occurred to him to visit Hamilton while he was in London. Indeed, he found the whole business exceedingly wearisome, and as soon as he possibly could he went back to Cornwall. The dominant thought in his mind was that he must return to Kestrel and start upon the great task which he had set himself, with Gaunt’s help. Nothing must interfere with that, and within half an hour of his return he was in conference with the doctor, in the ill-fated library where they had found Sir Anthony little more than a week before.
   “Doctor,” he began, “you and I have been great friends, and we must be frank with each other. In the past you have always scouted any suggestion that the curse of the Lovells had any basis upon fact. In view of my father’s last words, and the phenomena which accompanied his death, do you still hold to that opinion?”
   Gaunt did not reply at once, but lit a cigarette and inhaled thoughtfully. When he spoke, his musical voice was unusually grave.
   “Tony, I have never held that opinion in my own mind. If I have been guilty of deception you must forgive me. It was only because I did not think you were strong enough to bear the truth; in fact, you were definitely not when I first came here. Now I think the time has come when you must know.
   “Your father was perfectly right. There is something, something which the world calls supernatural, hidden beneath us. Now, I know that there is no supernatural, but I also know that there are phenomena which apparently contradict the usually accepted laws of nature, but which, nevertheless, are governed by quite definite laws of their own. Let us call them supernormal. Your family curse falls into this category.
   “When the last abbot of Kestrel laid the curse upon your ancestor he had no idea what he was doing. His words, uttered in the heat of the moment, prompted by a very real wrong which had been done to him, released a certain force which was pent up here. Whether or no, as the legends say, a necromancer of great power did dwell here in the remote past, I do not profess to know; but certainly there was an evil entity lying dormant at this point in the space-time continuum. Or, if you prefer, at this spot the veil of tangible matter was worn thin, and his words and intention served to rend it for a moment, and some creature of the outer darkness sprang through the gap.
   “Certainly all the accumulated ‘grace’ — to use a theological term — which had resulted from the many holy lives spent here in accordance with the Church’s law, the countless prayers which had continually ascended, and the hundreds of Masses which had been said within the Abbey walls, vanished in a flash, and the island became intensely vulnerable to the dark powers. We in Europe are so accustomed to living in an atmosphere saturated with grace that we do not realize the continual assaults of the powers of darkness, which are a commonplace in remote, pagan lands.
   “At any rate, explain it how you will, the fact remains: some supernormal monstrosity slipped through into the world, fortunately becoming attached to this place, and also, unhappily for you, to the family which dwelt here. I say fortunately because, had it been loosed upon the world at large, itwould have infallibly wreaked incalculable harm.
   “The gross and immoral conduct of the first Sir Anthony probably increased its power, and the black arts practiced by his successor undoubtedly had a much greater effect.”
   Tony had been staring at the doctor with steadily growing amazement, and now, at last, unable to contain himself any longer, he broke in with:
   “Doctor, do you seriously believe all this? It’s incredible! I didn’t think anyone believed in such things any more. And a man of your intelligence — “
   “That’s just it,” came the quick reply: “the more a man learns, the more he realizes that there is a vast realm of knowledge almost untouched by the human mind — the average human mind, I should say. Tony, we must face facts now or we are lost. Therearesuch things! This material world of ours, so fair and seemingly substantial, is but a painted veil which hangs between our eyes and the great unknown. And that unknown is often wonderfully beautiful, as the mystics know, and sometimes incredibly horrible, as such manifestations as this one prove.”
   Strangely shaken, Tony said:
   “The foundations of my world are crumbling. What am I to believe? Is it all a dream?”
   “It is but a dream, Tony. And beyond the dream are great realities.”
   “Show them to me, Doctor. Help me!”
   “I can if you will put yourself unreservedly into my hands.”
   “I can’t do anything else. I must trust you, Doctor. What shall I do? When my father died I swore an oath that I would not rest until this horror was rooted out.”
   “It will be a long and painful task, Tony. Great ends are only attained through mighty labour. First of all, with your permission, I will send to London for an associate of mine, a Mr. Simon Vaughan, who knows more about these things even than I do. He is a great student of supersensual phenomena, and he will know exactly what course to take with this one.”
   “Send for him quickly, then!”
   “He will be here at dawn.”
   “How?”
   “By road.”
   “So soon? How will you let him know?”
   “I have means of communication at my disposal which are not available to most men. Come, I will show you.”
   Together they went up to Gaunt’s room, and the doctor gave Tony a chair by the window. Then he lit the lamp which stood on a small table beside his bed. Unlocking a suitcase, he took out an object wrapped in black velvet. This proved to be a small crystal sphere, mounted on a brass disk, round the edge of which curious characters were engraved.
   He placed the crystal on the table beside the lamp and oriented it carefully with the aid of his pocket compass. Then he sat down by the table, rested his head on his hands, an elbow either side of the crystal, and gazed fixedly into the opalescent depths of the shining sphere.
   To Tony, watching, it seemed that the sphere began to glow with an internal radiance, which lit the intent face above it with a pale light. The doctor began to speak in a low, clear voice:
   “Simon Vaughan! Simon Vaughan! Are you listening? Come at once to Kestrel. Your friend has need of you. Nicholas Gaunt has need of you. Come quickly!”
   There was silence for a space, while the glow faded from the crystal. When it was dull and opaque once more Gaunt looked up:
   “He is coming, Tony. All will be well.”
   Tony put a hand to his bewildered head, and the doctor, with a gentle smile, rose and touched his shoulder, saying:
   “All this is very strange and new to you, Tony. To me it is just commonplace. Come down again and I will try and explain it a little.”
   When they were comfortably ensconced in the library, their cigarettes alight, Gaunt began:
   “All phenomena connected with thought-transference, clairvoyance, mind-reading, and the like, depend upon the existence of a state or dimension known as the astral plane. This is somewhat similar to the imponderable aether of the nineteenth-century physicists. It is a realm which is outside spaceand time, and yet is very close to us. In this respect it is not unlike the fourth dimension, beloved of science-fiction writers.
   “Almost any human mind can, when properly trained, attain a state of consciousness wherein this astral plane is reached, and since the limitations of space are non-existent thereon, two minds can have free intercourse, irrespective of the intervening distance, however great. Similarly the past isaccessible, and, to a less extent, the future, since time is without significance on that plane. Do I make myself clear?”
   “Admirably,” Tony answered with a wry smile, “if I accept all your premises. And I have no choice. But I suppose I myself, for instance, could not attain to this astral plane for lack of the special training?”
   “Not unaided. But I can demonstrate it to you if you wish.”
   “Please do, Doctor. It’s amazingly interesting.”
   “Very well. Look at me, and make your mind as empty as possible. Give me your hands.”
   Tony did as he was bid and looked into the doctor’s brilliant eyes. For a few moments he was only aware of the unwinking stare of the black pupils with their rings of grey iris; then he had a vivid impression of his material surroundings, the soft feel of the upholstered chair under him, the firm grip of Gaunt’s hands. The doctor said something he couldn’t understand, and simultaneously he seemed to fall headlong into the dark pool of the other’s eyes, which miraculously widened until they covered all else. He felt a faint tingling all over his body and at once lost all consciousness of it, becoming a discarnate mind. Everything wasblack, and he was alone in the blackness. He felt very lonely, and his mind turned towards Hamilton.
   Instantly there was a room about him, a vaguely familiar room, full of blue tobacco-smoke and the clattering of a typewriter. John Hamilton sat at his desk, pounding away, pipe in mouth. Behind him the window stood open to the cool night breeze, and the roar of Knightsbridge came pulsing in. Tony tried to speak to his friend, to step forward and touch him, but he could neither move nor make a sound. It was like a nightmare. Hamilton came to the bottom of a page, whipped it out, and sat reading it through. Feverishly Tony tried to attract his attention, and for a moment thought he had succeeded, for the other raised his eyes from his work and looked full at him, speculatively. But he only took another sheet, wound it into the machine, and set to work again.
   The room faded, like a dissolving“cut” in a film, and Tony was in darkness once more. He thought of Kestrel, and Gaunt, and immediately felt the doctor’s hands on his. Clutching at them like a drowning man, he struggled to the surface and lay gasping in his chair.
   “Satisfied?” smiled the doctor.
   Tony nodded dumbly. A thought struck him.
   “But was it real,” he asked, “or did you just suggest it to me?”
   “It was real enough. Your mind turned to your friend and went to him at once. Write and ask him what he was doing at this hour, if you like. There was no deception.”
   “It’s amazing, Doctor. Simply amazing.”
   “The powers of the human mind are always amazing to those who know little of them. I could show you things far more astonishing than that. I will, but not tonight. We must be up early in the morning to meet my friend Vaughan at Pentock.”
   II
   At just after nine o’clock next morning Tony and Gaunt climbed the harbour steps at Pentock and made their way to the Three Fishermen. Outside the inn they found a small crowd of villagers, standing round a long grey car, piled with luggage and covered with dust. The men made way respectfully for them as they approached, touching their caps and greeting the new master of Kestrel with a “Good morning to ’ee, zur!” Tony returned the salute and he and Gaunt passed inside, where they encountered the landlord’s wife, polishing the brass rail of the bar.
   She answered Tony’s query as to whether anyone had arrived for the Abbey with a nod of her head towards the back parlour.
   “He’s in there, Sir Anthony, having his breakfast. He came about half an hour ago.”
   From her tone of voice Tony gathered that the newcomer had not created a good impression, but he thanked her and followed Gaunt into the other room.
   At the table was an enormously fat man, of repellent appearance, making short work of a large plate of bacon and eggs. He got up as they appeared and shook hands with Gaunt, who turned to Tony, saying,
   “This is Mr. Simon Vaughan, Tony, of whom I told you.”
   Tony took the flabby cold hand with a faint feeling of disgust. The man reminded him of a toad he had once seen, sitting in a dark hole in the rocks. The same sleepy, watchful eyes; the same wide mouth and flat, hairless head. He was vaguely surprised by the courteous greeting he was given, but his tone was very cold and formal as he said:
   “How do you do, Mr. Vaughan? You had a good run down, I hope?”
   “Excellent, thank you, Sir Anthony. I must have averaged close on forty all the way. The car goes very well, Doctor.”
   Gaunt nodded.“She’s a good car. Mine, Tony. Care to have a look at her while Mr. Vaughan finishes his breakfast?”
   They went out into the sunshine; Tony, at least, with a definite feeling of relief. As he was examining the Bentley with keen interest the doctor spoke of his colleague.
   “Don’t be put off by first impressions, Tony. Vaughan is a charming fellow really, and has an amazing mind. His appearance is against him, I know, but when you get to know him you will like him as much as I do. He is probably the only man in England qualified to deal with our particular problem.”
   Naturally Tony denied that he had received any bad impression, but in his own heart he knew that his first reaction to Vaughan had been one of repulsion. However, he allowed that he might be mistaken.
   The subject of his thoughts presently joined them, smoking a long, thin cheroot, and wearing a great traveling-coat lined with fur. They took the car as near to the jetty as was possible and spent a strenuous five minutes transferring the three huge trunks to the launch.
   “Apparatus which I shall need for my investigations, mainly, Sir Anthony,” Vaughan explained, “not personal effects!”
   The Bentley was finally stabled at the inn, beside the old Buick belonging to the Abbey, which looked even more elderly and dilapidated beside its new companion. Tony drove the launch across to the island, mentally thanking Providence for a calm day, for the gunwales were within three inches of the water. However, the passage and the unloading at the Abbey harbour were accomplished without mishap, Lorrimer and Tregellis assisting.
   Gaunt went with the newcomer to his room and remained with him for some time, while Tony interviewed Mrs. Lorrimer about the domestic arrangements.
   A fire was crackling on the hearth in the great hall, for the place was never really warm, even at the height of summer, and Tony was sitting beside it when the others came down.
   Vaughan lowered himself cautiously into a chair, saying:
   “Well, Sir Anthony, the doctor has been telling me about your trouble. A very interesting case, I must say.”
   “Do you think you will be able to do anything about it, Mr. Vaughan?” asked Tony, handing him the cigarettes, which he passed on to Gaunt without taking one.
   “Yes, I’m almost sure I shall. But I must have your help, and Gaunt tells me you’re quite new to these matters. Almost a sceptic, I believe?”
   “I was until a few days ago, but I’m not now. Certainly I know very little about it.”
   “The doctor shall teach you all you need to know while I go about my preparations. I think we may say that there is little doubt but that the seat of the manifestations is in the crypt, eh, Gaunt?”
   The doctor nodded.“No doubt at all,” he said. “Nothing has ever been seen up here, has it, Tony?”
   “Not so far as I know, Doctor. The rooms we don’t use are all shut up, but I suppose we can rule them out. Everything points to the crypt, and yet when you took me down there we didn’t find anything unusual.”
   “No, but we must have missed something. There must be another exit. The whole place will have to be searched thoroughly. Our examination was of a rather perfunctory nature, you must admit.”
   “We will start our investigations there,” said Vaughan in a decided tone; “if they yield nothing of note, then we must try elsewhere. But first there is an old book, isn’t there? A history of the curse. The doctor told me of it.”
   “Yes, I’ll get it for you. It’s in the library.” And Tony fetched the ill-fated volume.
   Vaughan took it, saying:
   “Thank you, Sir Anthony. Now if you and the doctor will take a little walk I’ll read this through and get my facts in order.”
   Outside, in the bright sunshine which warmed half the courtyard, Tony asked Gaunt:
   “What will he do first, Doctor?”
   “I cannot say for certain. He has his own methods. But I should imagine that he will first endeavour to find the exact spot from which this evil influence operates. Then he will proceed to administer some corrective treatment, the exact nature of which will depend upon the class to which this being belongs. That is the usual procedure with haunted houses.”
   “And are all haunted houses occupied by an evil influence such as this?”
   “By no means. Many so-called ghosts are nothing more than impressions caused by past events of great significance, which at the time of their happening became photographed, as it were, upon the spiritual fibre of their surroundings, and which can be perceived by a sensitive mind.”
   “Then do the spirits of the dead never return to earth, Doctor?”
   “It depends what you mean by spirits, Tony,” the doctor replied, sitting down upon a garden seat against the outer wall. Tony joined him and lit a cigarette.
   “Explain, please,” he said.
   Gaunt marshaled his thoughts and began once more.
   “The human being is composed of three individual parts, each with a life of its own; there is the material body, which ceases to live at the moment of corporal death; there is the astral body, or vital principle, called by the old Egyptians the Ka, or Double; and there is the ego, the soul itself. At the moment of death these last two are released. What happens to the immortal soul, the personality, each must answer for himself in the light of his own faith. But the astral body, which, unlike the soul, is a replica of the material body, although composed of immaterial substance, may remain near the corpse, or on the scene of its death, for varying periods of time. It has no separate intelligence of its own, and without the guidance of the mind, which has gone with the soul, it may wander aimlessly about, or re-enact the circumstances of the corporal death perpetually. Here you have the explanation of another class of hauntings. Incidentally, it is possible for a trained mind to project this astral shell from the body during life, and, moving on the astral plane, to visit distant places and effect material results through its agency.”
   “I take it, then, that our particular haunting belongs to neither of these classes?” put in Tony.
   “No. Here we have an example of an inhuman entity, a being or spirit which has never occupied a bodily form, and never will. Such are often called elementals, or elemental spirits. Generally they are moderately harmless, and not particularly intelligent. They are responsible for the so-called poltergeist phenomena — aimless throwing about of furniture and crockery. In such cases they often operate through a medium of low mentality — a half-witted servant girl, say.
   “This curse of yours, however, seems to operate without the proximity of a medium, unless I am mistaken, and that in itself distinguishes it from the more ordinary type of elemental. Also it is definitely evil, and probably very powerful. I suspect that it is actually a monstrosity from the OuterDarkness — a sentient being from the chaos which exists behind the veil of created matter. If I am right in this assumption, then our task of expelling it presents enormous difficulties and fearful danger.”
   Tony sat still, absorbing this as best he could. When he spoke, he said:
   “Tell me, Doctor: where did you learn all this? And again — you keep referring to the unlimited power of properly trained minds. Where can such training be had?”
   Gaunt smiled enigmatically and looked up at the sky, against which a solitary seagull was sailing, its motionless white wings against the blue vying for purity with the rare, fleecy clouds far above. He seemed to be weighing something in his mind, for a faint line appeared between his brows and his lips compressed themselves. After a couple of minutes he came to a decision, and, looking back towards Tony, said:
   “That is a question which I may not answer in detail. I am bound by oath not to reveal the source of my training, but let it suffice that ever since the world began there has been this secret knowledge, handed down from generation to generation amongst a chosen few. There have been, and there arestill, secret societies formed to safeguard it, and to train initiates. The Rosicrucians were one, and still are, for that matter, though they do not advertise in the newspapers.
   “There are other so-called secret societies in existence today which used to have the secret wisdom, but which have lost all but the outward symbolism. I can think of one at this moment — I will not mention its name, though you must know to what I am referring — which with great wisdom has wrapped its true nature in so many veils that only a minute proportion of its members ever reach the inner mysteries. By an ingenious system of degrees and grades, only the most earnest seeker after knowledge is ever permitted to attain to complete initiation. Most of its members remain in the lower orders, practically ignorant of the possibilities which are open to them, content with philanthropy and symbolism.
   “In bygone centuries the mysteries of Crete and Samothrace, the Egyptian priests of Isis, the Druids — all knew the ancient wisdom. In this modern world of ours, so insistent upon material things, these high spiritual matters are still more closely guarded. One day the world will learn, in bitterness and desolation, that matter is not all, and that machinery cannot do everything, and it will cry out for guidance in the great dark, and we who keep the Mysteries will come back into our own.”
   The doctor spoke quietly, and yet with such seriousness and tremendous authority that Tony could not doubt his words. Turning them over in his mind, he realized at last what he had longed for unconsciously for so many years: a meaning in life; a purpose in existence. His soul, drugged with material things, suddenly awoke, and finding itself in darkness, began to cry out in a still, small voice for light. In the last few days his whole world had turned upside down, all values had strangely altered, and he felt that he could not go on in ignorance any longer. A great thirst for knowledge sprang up in his breast, and, his mind reeling, he mentally prostrated himself at Gaunt’s feet.
   “Doctor, help me! I want to know — so much. What death is — and, more, what life is. What is it all for? What does it mean? I’ll do anything you say, only help me!”
   Gaunt studied the eager face and burning blue eyes which gazed at him so beseechingly, and his own lean features softened.
   “That’s what they all say, Tony.” His voice was gentle, but infinitely sad. “The Way is long, and strewn with many pitfalls. Have you the courage of heart and the strength of will to face, it may be, years of seemingly fruitless effort?”
   Tony bowed his head.
   “I do not think I have the courage to face my empty life without it.” The words were almost inaudible, “Show me the Way!”
   The doctor smiled tenderly, and laid his hand on the young man’s arm.
   “Very well, then,” he said; “I must first apply to my superiors for permission, but I don’t anticipate any difficulty there. I will begin your pre-initiation training at once.”
   Chapter VII
   When Tony and the doctor went in to lunch they found that Vaughan had acquainted himself with the whole of the contents of the book, and professed himself ready to start work that afternoon. The meal was served in the library, as usual, and afterwards all three descended into the crypt, both Gaunt and his colleague carrying powerful electric torches.
   The place was quite as dark by day as by night, but the lamps were greatly superior to that which Tony had used on his last visit with the doctor, and threw a beam quite a hundred yards long. Consequently Gaunt was able to pretend to discover the altar, the whereabouts of which, of course, he knew perfectly well, without arousing Tony’s suspicions in the slightest degree.
   At sight of the altar Vaughan became greatly excited, and ran up the steps with an agility surprising in one of his bulk. He bent over the upper slab, examining it minutely with his torch, uttering low grunts of satisfaction. The other two left him at it, and returned to the hall above to carry down two of his trunks, which had been deposited beside the trap-door at his instructions.
   This proved to be an exceedingly difficult task, since the stairway was narrow, and the boxes both large and heavy. It took quite ten minutes’ strenuous labour before both trunks were finally deposited near the altar, which Vaughan was still examining closely. At last he turned to the others.
   “There is no doubt, Sir Anthony,” he said in his thick voice, “but that this has been used for purposes other than that which its builders intended, and I think we shall find that this is the source of the phenomena connected with the curse. There must be some way of raising this stone, but Icannot find it at present. Have you any ideas, Gaunt?”
   The doctor joined him, and spent some minutes pretending to look for the catch. After much fumbling he released it, with an exclamation of surprise, and together the two lifted the altar-stone on its counterpoised pivot.
   Tony uttered a cry of astonishment as the great block of granite swung upwards, and darted forward eagerly, only to recoil as the foetid stench from the depths blew in his face.
   “What a ghastly smell!” he exclaimed, half choking.
   “No ventilation,” remarked Vaughan, “and perhaps — something else, eh, Gaunt?”
   The doctor nodded, and addressed Tony.
   “Are you game to go down with us?” he asked.
   Without a deal of enthusiasm Tony assured him that he was ready for anything. He followed readily enough, however, as Gaunt clambered over the side, and began to descend the steep stone steps within, shining his lamp cautiously before his feet. Vaughan brought up the rear.
   The steps, which, though not worn, were damp and slippery, led steeply down for some twenty feet, and were continued by a long corridor, cut in the solid rock. The air was very close and hot, but Tony thought the smell a little less unpleasant than at first, though he was perhaps merely growing more accustomed to it.
   The tunnel led them downwards, at a slight incline, for a short distance, then turned abruptly, ran level for a little way, and finally divided into three.
   At this point the party paused, uncertain which way to take, until Gaunt suggested that they should try the middle passage. After following this still downwards for a long distance they found their progress blocked by a wooden door, much decayed, and held together by rusted iron bands. There was a crude bar securing this, and a short struggle released it, whereupon the door opened unwillingly, with a nerve-shaking scream of rusty hinges, and they felt a breath of sweet salt air on their faces.
   Beyond the door another flight of steps led them still further downwards, until they became aware of a faint grey light ahead. The tunnel narrowed abruptly, and became so low that they were obliged to bend almost double, Vaughan puffing and wheezing with the effort. Thirty yards of this uncomfortable progress brought them to a natural cave. Gratefully standing upright on the sandy floor, they approached the opening, through which poured a flood of dazzling sunlight.
   Here was a narrow ledge, wet with spray from the waves, which were breaking only a couple of yards below. Outside the open sea stretched empty to the horizon. Tony judged that this must be the side of the island opposite to that upon which the harbour lay, at a point never approached by boat owing to the sheer cliffs and dangerous rocks.
   They stayed there in the sunlight for a while, watching the gulls and enjoying the fresh air, until Gaunt suggested that they should retrace their steps and try one of the other passages. Somewhat reluctantly Tony agreed, and the three made their way back into the close darkness, barring the ancient door behind them.
   When they reached the division of the ways once more Gaunt spun a coin, and chose the left-hand tunnel. This led steeply down into the very bowels of the island, twisting and turning bewilderingly. They passed the mouths of three other passages, and it occurred to Tony that this place must be a veritable honeycomb, and profoundly unpleasant to be lost in without a light. The floor was very uneven, and strewn with fallen rocks; and great patches of slime on the walls glistened in the torchlight. It seemed that they must actually be below sea-level when the passage turned sharply to the right, and they emerged into a great open space. Gaunt, who was still in front, stopped with a sharp cry of warning, and the others stood rooted in their tracks, Tony’s heart going like a trip-hammer. The doctor directed his torch downwards, and they could see the reason for his warning.
   He stood on the very edge of an abyss, for the ledge upon which the tunnel opened formed a rocky platform high up on the wall of a vast cavern, like the nave of some great cathedral. Further investigation revealed an irregular pathway leading down the wall to the floor of the place, at least a hundred feet below. This they descended carefully, and eventually stood on the level ground. The stench was appalling, and the air was very hot, but there was no sign of anything supernatural, though the profound silence seemed in itself a menace. Even Gaunt’s voice was hushed as he said:
   “This place cannot be other than natural — volcanic action, possibly, though the rocks are not igneous. No race we know of could have fashioned it.”
   He walked slowly out into the middle of the cavern floor, which was surprisingly smooth and regular. The others followed; and the three stood together, turning the beams of their torches first this way, then that. Powerful though the lamps were, their light only just reached the walls, and quite failed to penetrate the gloom overhead, where the mighty vault of the roof supported the hundreds of tons of rock above it. Under any circumstances it would have been an awe-inspiring place, but, seeking what they sought, the empty, echoing vastness was truly horrific. Tony fully expected some nightmare creature to come rushing out at them at any moment, but nothing stirred. There were no other entrances, no other caves opening out, no dark corners where anything could be hidden.
   “It must be here,” Vaughan whispered huskily, “but where?”
   All at once Tony realized that he was right: there was something here, something besides themselves, something not of this world. A dreadful sensation of being watched began to grow in his mind. Something monstrous and terribly powerful was aware of these intruders in its lair; soon it would strike. A feeling of gradually mounting tension, like that before the breaking of a thunderstorm, was piling up around them. The shadows grew deeper; the beams of the torches seemed to waver and grow dim. A breath of icy cold air, in frightful contrast to the prevailing heat, stirred Tony’s hair, and a faint shudder ran through the rock beneath their feet.
   “Come, we must get out of this!” Gaunt’s voice cut the silence like the crack of a whip. He began to run towards the foot of the pathway leading up to the tunnel from which they had come. Vaughan seized Tony by the arm and, half dragging the young man, followed him. By the time they reached the side of the cavern Tony had shaken off the lethargy which had seemed to dull his brain, and as hurriedly as was possible in safety the three clambered up to the ledge. Tony would have lingered there, but Gaunt and his colleague both caught his arms and rushed him up the passage.
   “We dare not stop another moment,” the doctor insisted as they went; “in a few more seconds it would have materialized; and to wait for that, unprotected as we are, would have been madness.”
   Tony himself failed to see what all the excitement was about, but he allowed that his companions knew more about these matters than he did, and he did not argue. As last they reached the steps leading up into the altar, and climbed out into the crypt above. Before he shut the pivoted slab Gaunt pointed to a curious design chiseled on the under side of the stone.
   “I don’t suppose it often leaves the great cave,” he said, “but if it did, that would prevent it getting any farther.”
   Tony peered at the interlaced triangles and shook his head.
   “It’s too deep for me,” he admitted.
   The doctor smiled.
   “You will understand one day,” he said.
   After dinner Tony asked what the next step would be, and Vaughan answered him:
   “The doctor and I will have to go down again, after taking suitable measures to protect ourselves. It is absolutely necessary that we see the thing in action before we can set about the task of destroying it. We do not yet know what form it takes when materialized, even. Later you will have to help us, but you will have to learn how to protect yourself also before you can do that. Gaunt will teach you, if you will only follow his instructions absolutely.”
   Tony assured him that he was only too eager to begin his studies; and shortly afterwards they retired for the night.
   While he was undressing it occurred to Tony how completely he had misjudged Vaughan when he had first met him that morning. The man was charming: his conversation brilliant, and his manners gentle. The gross exterior was soon forgotten in the light of his true personality. Telling himself not to be so hasty in future, the young man climbed into bed, blew out his candle, and soon fell asleep. His nerve-raking experiences in the caves did not trouble him at all; in the new wisdom he was learning from Gaunt they appeared to be quite natural, and he felt wonderfully secure in the hands of his wise and experienced friend.
   The clock in the hall below was striking two when Gaunt’s door opened softly and the doctor passed silently down the gallery, disappearing into Vaughan’s room. Both were wearing felt-soled shoes when they emerged, and Gaunt was carrying his torch, but the light was unnecessary as they went down the staircase, for the moon was shining through the high, narrow windows of the hall. Beneath the staircase the moon did not penetrate, and the crypt was as black as ever when they reached it.
   Gaunt set his torch on the altar steps while his companion unlocked one of the trunks which had been carried down that afternoon. Out of the capacious interior he extracted two neatly folded white bundles, one of which he handed to the doctor. These proved to be long garments of linen, not unlike priests’ albs, which covered the wearers from neck to ankle, being girt about the middle with a scarlet cord. Round the hem of the skirt and the cuffs cabalistic symbols were embroidered in red silk. When they had attired themselves in these Vaughan went again to the trunk and took out various other articles, which he set upon the altar. There were two circlets of lead, curiously engraved; two metal rods, which glittered oddly in the dim light; and a glass vessel containing a dark liquid.
   “You performed the consecration properly?” Gaunt asked in a low voice. “Our lives depend upon it.” To which the other replied, his thick lips trembling:
   “Nothing has been forgotten. I know the danger. Now the ointment”; and, taking up the glass vessel, he proceeded to anoint the doctor’s head and hands, muttering some formula the while. When he had done Gaunt performed a like service for him, and returned the vessel to the trunk. Then they set the leaden circles on their heads and took the rods in their left hands.
   “We must leave the torch; we dare not show a light,” said Gaunt, as they lifted the altar-stone. Vaughan nodded silently, and they passed down the slippery steps, feeling their way in the thick darkness, and almost choking with the appalling smell, now far worse than it had been in the afternoon.
   It was slow going in the dark, and their clinging robes did not help them, but at last they reached the division of the ways. After some groping they found the left-hand tunnel, and continued cautiously along it. Suddenly Gaunt stopped, and caught his companion by the sleeve.
   “Do you hear it?” he whispered.
   Vaughan listened, shivering slightly. From the pitchy blackness in front came a low breathing sound, something like the wind, but more regular. A long, slow breathing, like a great animal asleep.
   Even more cautiously than before the two crept forward, hugging the rough wall on their right. Once they crossed the mouth of a side tunnel, and had to stumble unaided for a few feet. Their felt shoes were saturated with the slime underfoot, and made little squelching sounds as they walked. The heat grew intense, and great drops of sweat trickled from beneath the lead bands on their foreheads. Their lungs laboured in the foul air.
   The breathing sound in front stopped. Gaunt’s fingers tightened on his colleague’s arm as they stood still, waiting. A slight vibration ran through the rock beneath.
   “It is awake,” the doctor whispered, his tongue rustling like paper in his dry mouth. Vaughan’s great body was quivering like a jelly, but he strove manfully to remain calm. Silently they pressed forward once more.
   Presently they became aware of a faint greenish glow in the darkness ahead, and almost before they knew it they were at the bend of the passage. Here Vaughan’s courage well-nigh failed him altogether, and he would have fallen but for Gaunt’s arm. The doctor turned upon him fiercely.
   “Have you forgotten the oath?” he whispered hoarsely. “Shall it be said that only they have courage?”; and, dragging his unwilling companion, he turned the corner, and they came out upon the ledge in the great cavern.
   It was very different from when they had last looked upon it. Now the whole vast space was permeated by a strange green radiance, which appeared to emanate from the rock of the floor far below. The walls around, the domed roof above, were plainly visible; and the strangely attired pair on the ledge could see each other clearly in the weird light. A monstrous silence pressed like an invisible cloud upon their heads, and waves of almost intolerable heat beat upon their pallid faces. The stench was abominable.
   Vaughan found words.
   “Where — where is it?” he gulped.
   Gaunt pointed downwards with the rod in his hand, and the other peered fearfully over the brink. Then he too saw.
   The whole rocky floor, acres in extent, was in motion. Ever so slight it was, like the stirring of molten metal, the heaving of that seemingly solid surface, but horrible in a way that nothing else could be, so contrary was it to the laws which hold this world together. From it beat the pale-green light; and to and fro over the surface thin vapours came and went.
   Vaughan stared at the appalling sight in silence for some minutes, his eyes protruding from their sockets, so fascinated that even the trembling of his limbs was stilled. Then, as they watched, the movement ceased, except for one spot at the centre, where the solid rock began to belly upwards in a mound, like a great tumour. It reached a height of perhaps ten feet before its summit fissured, and from the crack a black substance came welling out, flowing down on to the floor around in an inky pool. At the same instant the frightful heat lessened and passed away, to be replaced by a wave of unearthly cold, which froze the sweat upon the livid faces of the watchers on the ledge.
   As the black liquid oozed on to the floor of the cave, so it thickened into a jelly-like substance, not spreading out, but piling up into a solid mass, which quivered and writhed incessantly with horrid life. Suddenly Vaughan, who had begun to shudder violently once more, buried his face in Gaunt’s linen sleeve, shutting out the sight he could no longer endure. The doctor shook him off angrily, saying:
   “Be still, you fool! It knows you are afraid. Look!”
   For the unholy thing below was flowing across the rocky floor towards the wall of the cavern upon which they were perched. It was without form, and changed its shape continually as it moved, but that it was sentient was undeniable, and Vaughan had a vivid impression of a Personality, veiled in the darkness of its substance, which silently mocked the two feeble human creatures opposed to it.
   In a moment the great bulk of the thing was massed at the foot of the cliff beneath; then it began to climb, flowing up the rock as easily as it had crossed the level floor. Vaughan uttered a strangled cry, like a stricken animal, and, turning, fled up the tunnel behind them. Gaunt hesitated for a second, then let him go, with a muttered oath, and, stepping to the very brink, coolly faced the abomination crawling up towards him. As it came he felt the icy cold which emanated from it freezing his very limbs, but his hand was perfectly steady as he pointed the metal rod he held downwards at it. Concentrating his will to the uttermost, he began to recite certain ritual words in a firm voice, softly at first, then more loudly, until the tremendous Latin echoed round the great dome above.
   The effect was immediate. The thing ceased its upward movement and stopped, clinging to the face of the wall like a gigantic limpet. It had no visible eyes, but the doctor could feel its cold regard searing into his brain, and it was only by a mighty effort that he was able to withstand the frightful power which beat against him. Even now he knew he could not hold it off indefinitely, and so, still chanting in a high, clear voice, he began to walk slowly backwards up the passage. It was slow, painful progress, for he had only one hand free to feel his way along the wall, and after he had gone fifty paces in this fashion, since the thing did not appear to be following him, he reverted to the usual method of progression, and in due course reached the steps leading up to the crypt. By this time the reaction had set in, and even his iron will could not entirely still the trembling of his knees as he climbed.
   When he had closed the altar he looked round for Vaughan. An electric torch lay burning on the floor, and by its dim light he could see his colleague’s figure, crouched grotesquely on the steps, his face hidden in his hands. He was sobbing brokenly, and muttering beneath his breath. As he strode towards him Gaunt caught the words: “Jesu! Mary!” With an exclamation of disgust he launched a kick at the prostrate form, and Vaughan rolled over, covering his face with his hands and moaning piteously.
   “Judas!” hissed the doctor. “Is this a time to turn your coat again?”
   The other writhed towards him, pawing at his feet.
   “Mercy, master, mercy!” he moaned.
   “Why should I show you mercy?” the doctor went on with withering contempt. “But for me you would not have got ten yards along that passage. And if it had caught you — you know what the end would have been? You would have been lost for ever. I could well have spared you, though your cowardice nearly ruined everything. It was all I could do to hold it back alone; you putmy soul in jeopardy. Well, I can forgive that; but almost to wreck our plans— that I find hard to overlook.”
   “Forgive me, master! I will not fail again, I swear. I had never seen anything like that before, and it unnerved me utterly. You — you trembled too.”
   “My poor mortal flesh may have quaked, but my soul was unafraid. Yours was — that is the difference. Very well, Simon, I will forgive you this time, but not again.”
   “Oh, master! There shall be no more turning back.” Vaughan rose on his knees. “I will say the Mass tomorrow.”
   “If it comforts you, do so. You have the accessories here? I will serve you.”
   “That is an honour, master, which I shall not forget.”
   “Very well. Now get up and compose yourself. Take off those things, and join me in a cigarette.”
   When they had removed their vestments, and were sitting smoking on the altar steps, Vaughan asked:
   “Did it follow you?”
   The doctor shook his head.
   “I don’t think it often leaves the great cavern. As it was, our visit woke it to quite unusual activity. I imagine that it generally lies dormant.”
   “Are you satisfied that it is what we thought — a true monstrosity of the Outer Darkness?”
   “I am sure of it — nothing less could have withstood the formula I used. Besides, you felt its power.”
   Vaughan nodded gloomily.
   “Merlin succeeded, then?” he asked.
   Gaunt laughed softly.
   “Merlin! What does that name mean to the average man? A benevolent old man — a magician, true, but with a soul as white as his beard! What a lot we have to thank Mallory and Tennyson for, Simon. Little do they know what that being they call Merlin was: one of us, and perhaps the greatest wizardof all time. Yes, he succeeded in doing that which has never been done before or since: he made a gateway through the Veil, there in that very cavern, and admitted one of the horrors which dwell in Outer Darkness. I often wonder what he proposed to do with it. Perhaps he found it more intractable than he had supposed, and, unable to expel it again, bound it to this place.”
   “Then it was here before the Abbot pronounced his curse on the Lovells?”
   “Undoubtedly. His words, inadvertently phrased in the form of the Osirian ritual, coupled with his intention of ruining the Lovell family, merely served to link their destiny with it.”
   “Do you think we shall be able to turn it to our purpose?”
   Gaunt frowned.
   “First it must be released from its bondage to this family, and neither you nor I can do that.”
   “Who, then?”
   “Anthony Lovell.”
   “That young fool?”
   “No one else. I have already begun his training; he does not know to what end, naturally, nor will he until it is too late.”
   Chapter VIII
   John Hamilton was walking down Fleet Street one afternoon when his soul suddenly rebelled against the tyranny of London. It was the second week in August, and for nearly a month no rain had fallen. The shortage of water was already growing acute, and there was talk of rationing the supplies. Devastating heath fires were daily reported.
   In the city the heat was well-nigh intolerable; the dust rose in clouds from the wheels of the roaring traffic, drying Hamilton’s throat, making his eyes smart, and tasting gritty in his mouth. His shoes seemed no protection against the heated pavement; life itself appeared to be a refined torture at that moment.
   He thought longingly of escape from the Metropolis, but where should he go? In the open country it would be little better: the fields were burnt brown; the hedgerows thick with a pall of white dust. Where, then? Yellow sands; a cool breeze from the sea; the black shadow of mighty cliffs: this inviting picture rose in his tired brain. There the sun would blaze in a sky of cobalt instead of vibrating against the brazen lid of London.
   Three months ago Tony had invited him to Kestrel. Why should he not avail himself of the invitation now, and seek a short respite from toil? True, Tony had not mentioned the matter again in the brief acknowledgment he had written in reply to Hamilton’s letter of sympathy after his father’s death, but then he was probably worried with other matters at the time. So Hamilton told himself, but he could find no similar explanation for the way in which his friend had completely ignored another letter he had written him, only a couple of weeks ago, when the idea of accepting Tony’s invitation had recurred to him. In spite of his knowledge of his friend’s casual habits over letters, this silence worried him a little, and in response to some subconscious prompting he had called at Dr. Gaunt’s house in Hampstead to see whether they had any news from Kestrel. There he had found the shutters up and the place apparently deserted.
   Surmising that the doctor was still at Kestrel, Hamilton now began to wonder if Tony had fallen ill, in the same fashion as his father; and the sum total of his musings led him to Paddington next morning, suitcase in hand, en route for Cornwall.
   The train was insufferably hot, and the journey seemed interminable; consequently it was with considerable relief that he finally descended from the local at Redruth. He had deliberately sent no word of his coming to Tony, making up his mind to stay at Pentock, and find out for himself how things were at the Abbey. He had no difficulty in hiring a car to take him to his destination, and within three-quarters of an hour he was in the sanded bar of the Three Fishermen, asking the red-faced landlord, Dykes by name, for a room.
   After removing the stains of travel from his person Hamilton had a meal, unpacked his suitcase, and then strolled out into the cool evening, smoking his pipe.
   He walked down the narrow cobbled street, with its row of whitewashed cottages, from whose doorways women, enjoying the sea breeze, eyed him curiously, to the harbour. A shoal of pilchards had just been sighted, and the boats were putting out. After watching the activity for a while he climbed the stepped pathway up the steep hillside, past the little church, with its squat grey tower, on to the cliffs.
   Finding a spot where he could lounge and enjoy his pipe, his feet only a few inches from the brink, he sank down on the short wiry grass and gazed over the darkening sea. The sun was sinking in a haze of glory, obscuring the horizon, so that sea and sky were indistinguishable, and in the midst of the golden glow Kestrel Island hung between heaven and earth. In silhouette, the merging of island rock and Abbey walls was quite lost, and the whole seemed carved out of one mighty block of stone by some superhuman sculptor, and set there as a memorial to a forgotten past.
   Hamilton’s mind flew back to the legend that it was the last remnant of lost Lyonesse, where Merlin built his faëry castle.
   “The island valley of Avilion, where there is neither hail nor rain, nor any snow, nor ever wind blows loudly,” he quoted softly, and awoke from his reverie with a start, as a voice behind him remarked:
   “I always understood that the vale of Avalon was generally considered to be at Glastonbury, but then, I may well be wrong.”
   The speaker sat down beside him, and Hamilton saw a slight figure in a shabby cassock, with a gentle, scholarly face surmounted by a shock of snow-white hair disheveled by the breeze.
   “My name’s Bennett,” said the stranger, “Michael Bennett. I’m rector at St. Martin’s here. You are a visitor, of course.”
   Hamilton introduced himself, and the two shook hands. The rector continued:
   “That smells like an excellent tobacco. May I beg a pipeful?”
   He took an ancient briar from his cassock pocket and began to fill it from Hamilton’s pouch.
   “You see, I am a poor man,” he explained simply, “and I have smoked my allowance for the week.”
   He lit up, and smoked in silence for some minutes; then:
   “You are a writer, of course? A poet, perhaps?”
   “Hack-work, mainly, I’m afraid.” Hamilton shrugged deprecatingly. “I can’t afford to write as much poetry as I would wish.”
   “But you do write a little. I thought as much, though I must admit that the Abbey looks lovely enough tonight to awake the poet in any man.”
   “Do you know Sir Anthony?” asked Hamilton.
   “The present one, you mean? Not very well. I have spoken to him once or twice. I knew his father well. You heard of the tragedy?”
   Hamilton nodded.
   “Tony is one of my best friends.”
   “Ah! You are visiting him, then?”
   “No, not yet. I’m staying at the Three Fishermen tonight. He doesn’t know I’m here.”
   “No?” The old man showed no curiosity, but Hamilton felt a strange urge to be utterly frank with this gentle, unassuming creature.
   “I’m worried about him,” he went on. “He didn’t reply to my last letter — I haven’t heard from him for months. So I came down, partly to see if he was all right.”
   “I see. I think I can reassure you on one point: he is in the best of health. I was talking to one of the Abbey servants — a man named Tregellis — only this morning. He comes across for provisions most days.”
   “I’m very glad to hear that.” There was much relief in Hamilton’s voice. “Do you know if there is anyone else staying there, sir?”
   “There are two guests, Mr. Hamilton. There is Dr. Gaunt, who has been there since before old Sir Anthony died, and a Mr. Simon Vaughan, who came shortly after that unhappy accident.”
   “Oh! Who is this Mr. Vaughan? Dr. Gaunt I know. It was I who found him for Tony.”
   The rector blew out a cloud of smoke and turned his head slowly towards Hamilton.
   “Really!” he said. “A charming man. I met him at the funeral. I believe Simon Vaughan in a colleague of his from London. A psychic investigator, I am told he calls himself. I hear all the gossip, you see, Mr. Hamilton.”
   “A psychic investigator? What does it all mean, sir? What’s going on over there?”
   “I think they are endeavouring to get to the bottom of this so-called curse. They hope to destroy it eventually. Or so I am told.”
   Hamilton digested this information. Then he asked:
   “What is your opinion about it all, sir? Do you believe there is any foundation for the legend?”
   “Mr. Hamilton, when you reach my age you will learn never to scoff at other people’s beliefs, because those beliefs often come to have a real existence, simply because they are believed in. A great wrong was done on that island by the first of the Lovells, and hid descendants have believed eversince that they are suffering for it. It may be so, I cannot say. But the ways of the Almighty are infinite, and should not be examined too curiously. If Sir Anthony had listened to me he might have been alive today.”
   “Why, sir — what do you mean?”
   “He was a good Christian once, and used to come over to church every Sunday. He would lunch with me afterwards, and we had many long walks together. He told me of his conviction that somewhere in the vaults below the Abbey was hidden the thing, being — call it what you will — which was the embodiment of the curse. And the last time I saw him alive he expressed his determination to seek it out. I begged him to leave ill alone: to resort only to prayer, and the Sacraments of the Church. I even offered to go to the Abbey and perform the ancient ceremony of exorcism. I am probably an old fool, but I believe in these things, you see.
   “He would not heed me; he did go down into that crypt, and what he found I don’t know, for I never saw him again. Even after he had recovered from his illness, through the ministrations of your Dr. Gaunt, he never came to see me, or to church even. And I am not one to thrust myself in where I am not wanted.
   “So you see why I am appalled at the thought of your friend going the self-same way his father went. He seems a nice young fellow — I don’t suppose he is more than a nominal Christian, so few are these days, and he has not even that to support him. He and those friends of his are meddling with matters that should not be meddled with. I am desperately afraid for him.”
   Hamilton sat silent for some minutes after the other had finished speaking. Darkness had fallen, and the first stars were beginning to sprinkle the deep blue overhead. The island was only a dark blot on the grey sea.
   “Thank you for telling me all this, sir,” he said at last. “I must go to him, and see what I can do.”
   “God go with you, my son,” the rector replied, getting to his feet a trifle stiffly, “and if an old man’s vapourings prove groundless, forgive me.”
   Together they walked back down the steep path. The rectory stood close by the church, and at the gate the rector stopped.
   “Are you a Catholic, Mr. Hamilton?” he asked.
   “I was brought up in the Church of England,” the other had started to reply, but the old man broke in:
   “No, no! I was not referring to our Roman brethren. I mean — do you use the Sacraments of the Church in which you were baptized? Don’t think me impertinent, but as one of the least of her priests I have a right to know.”
   “I’m afraid I have not been very regular for some years. Things slide, you know, sir.”
   “Yes, I know. But if you are going to that island, I would advise you to consider these things. They are rather important. And if you want any help or advice, come to me.”
   “I will, sir, thank you. Good night.”
   “Good night, my son. God bless you.”
   They shook hands, and Hamilton strode off towards the village. The rector stood watching him for a moment, then he crossed himself, murmuring:
   “Sweet Jesus, most strong, most holy! Guard Thy servant, who goes into the midst of so many and great dangers!”
   He opened the gate and went into his own house.
   While he was having a nightcap Hamilton told the landlord that he had met the rector:
   “Ah, old Father Bennett!” exclaimed Dykes. “ ’E’s a good sort. Bit ’Igh, per’aps — incense and the likes o’ that, if you know what I mean, sir — but we likes ’im, we does. ’E means no ’arm. The fisherfolk love ’im like a father. Blesses their boats for ’em. ’E comes in ’ere for a glass now and then, with the best of ’em. Could do with more parsons like that, sir.”
   Hamilton heartily agreed with this conclusion, and presently went to bed, with much to think upon.
   He was awakened early next morning by the crying of the gulls over the harbour, as the boats came in, laden with the fruits of the night’s toil. After breakfast he began to explore the possibilities of getting to the Abbey. He particularly wished to avoid attracting attention by chartering a boat to take him across, and was considerably relieved to learn that Tom Tregellis invariably called at the inn when he came over for provisions.
   He was sitting in the bar when that worthy entered, and, hearing the landlord call him by name, approached and offered him a drink. The dour Cornishman accepted without surprise, and they sat down at a little table in the corner, their tankards before them. Hamilton explained that he was a friend of Sir Anthony’s, and wanted to pay him a surprise visit, and after the tankards had been refilled several times Tregellis departed, telling him to be at the harbour in half an hour’s time.
   There they met, Hamilton carrying his suitcase and Tregellis a basket of assorted groceries. They climbed down into the trim launch, and inside half an hour were climbing the worn stairway leading up to the Abbey.
   The wicket in the outer gate stood open, and they passed through, Hamilton staring about him in amazement at the broad flagged courtyard, and the square bulk of the building rearing its turrets into the blue. He had not been on the island before, and was intensely interested by everything he saw.
   Lorrimer, who must have been watching for the launch, appeared at the door, and stood waiting, looking rather doubtfully at Hamilton and his luggage. It was evident that uninvited guests were not a common feature of life on Kestrel. Tregellis, without a word of explanation, left his companion to his own devices and departed with his basket towards the rear quarters. Hamilton addressed Lorrimer:
   “I don’t think Sir Anthony is expecting me, but I am an old friend — my name’s Hamilton.”
   The servant’s face crinkled into a smile.
   “Oh, yes, of course, sir. I’ve often heard Sir Anthony speak of you. He told me some months ago that he had invited you down. Will you step inside, sir? I will tell Sir Anthony you are here.”
   Hamilton suffered himself to be led into the great hall and relieved of his hat and bag. Lorrimer asked him to be seated and retired towards the library.
   Left to himself, the visitor stood with his back to the cavernous hearth, empty for once, since the great heat had penetrated even these ponderous walls. He looked round curiously, the least bit overawed by the mediaeval grandeur of the place, gloomy in spite of the narrow beams of sunlight which crept in through the high windows.
   He had not long to wait, however, for scarcely had Lorrimer disappeared when Tony came bursting in, almost running across the stone floor to greet his friend.
   “John, by all that’s holy! Iam glad to see you, old man!” he cried, wringing his hand. “Do sit down. Why ever didn’t you let me know you were coming?”
   “I came quite by chance, Tony. I just happened to be taking a little holiday in the neighbourhood, and thought I’d pop over and look you up.”
   “Well, now you’re here at last, you must stay for a while.”
   “Thanks, I’d love to.” Hamilton was studying his friend narrowly. This was a different Tony, in spite of the familiar exuberance of his greeting — and even that was false. He was not glad to see him, and didn’t really want him to stay. There was a look of strain about his face, and a strange depth in the blue eyes, once so gay and careless, that sent a chill to Hamilton’s heart. His mouth, too, once the weakest point of the whole face, was now set in unnaturally firm lines.
   “Didn’t you get my last letter, Tony?” he asked carelessly, taking out his pipe as Tony lit a cigarette.
   “Yes, of course; thanks, old man — I answered it, surely?” Tony was intent upon his cigarette.
   “You didn’t. I was a little worried.”
   “What a careless beast I am, John! I know I wrote a reply. It’s probably still in a pocket somewhere. Iam sorry!”
   “It’s all right, Tony. I thought you might be ill, that’s all.”
   “I was never better in my life. This place suits me absolutely. You were perfectly right about it, John, it’s marvelous. I can’t think why I never thought so before.”
   “Is Dr. Gaunt still here?”
   “Why, yes, he’s in the library now. You must come and meet him again. He’s a charming fellow. There’s a pal of his here too — chap called Vaughan — sort of spiritualist johnny. He thinks he can fix up the jolly old curse — more power to him! Now come along and see Gaunt.”
   He literally dragged his friend off to the library.
   As they entered, the doctor, who was sitting at the long table, strewn with books and papers, rose and came forward, saying:
   “Ah, Mr. Hamilton! We’ve met before, I think.”
   “Yes, Doctor, once. How do you do?”
   They shook hands, and immediately Hamilton felt his vague apprehensions concerning Gaunt’s continued presence here disappear before his delighted personality. This man could do no one any harm, he told himself.
   “And how is London looking, Mr. Hamilton?” the doctor asked.
   “Terrible in this heat. I must confess I ran away. Couldn’t stand it any longer.”
   “Wise man! I think we’re better off here, eh, Tony?”
   “Rather! John, you must stay with us — mustn’t he, Doctor?”
   “Of course he must. Now, Mr. Hamilton, as a medical man, I prescribe a few weeks of sea air, and no worries.”
   Hamilton laughed.
   “You’re both very good. If it’s not overtaxing your domestic arrangements, Tony, I’d like nothing better.”
   “Mrs. Lorrimer will be able to manage. We’ve got Johnston here as well now, you know,” Tony said, pulling the bell-rope.
   “What’s happened to your home in Town, Tony?” queried Hamilton.
   “Sold,” the other replied laconically; “privately, of course. I didn’t want that place on my hands. And I’d given up the flat, too. Kestrel is good enough for me.”
   At this juncture Lorrimer appeared at the door, and to him Tony said:
   “Mr. Hamilton will be staying some time, Lorrimer. Put his things in the tower room. You’ll love that, John, it’s awfully quaint. Perhaps you’d like a wash before lunch? Show Mr. Hamilton up, Lorrimer.”
   When they had gone, Gaunt remarked coldly:
   “Most inopportune, your friend’s visit, Tony. He could scarcely have come at a worse time.”
   “I know. I’m awfully sorry, Doctor, but what could I do? I couldn’t send him away. He is my friend, after all.”
   “We who follow the Way have little time for friends, Tony, and small room in our hearts for them. Purge yourself of all earthly love, my son.”
   “I’ll try, Doctor,” Tony replied humbly. “Can we carry on at all while he’s here?”
   “We must. If he stays too long, I will persuade him to go, somehow. Leave that to me.”
   “May I tell him something of what you are teaching me?” the young man asked. “He will wonder what we are doing if I don’t, and perhaps he too might want to join us.”
   “Missionary zeal already, Tony? No, we don’t win followers that way. But you can tell him enough to satisfy his curiosity. Since you are not yet initiated, you cannot reveal the inner secrets.”
   The tower room, to which Lorrimer conducted Hamilton, was approached by a spiral staircase from the end of the long gallery. It had not been used in Tony’s father’s day, and had only recently been prepared for just such an occasion as this. It occupied the upper portion of one of the two towers which surmounted the Abbey, and was circular in shape, with four windows, set in deep embrasures, commanding every point of the compass. The staircase went on past its door to the roof of the tower.
   Lorrimer ushered Hamilton inside and set his bag on the four-poster bed which stood in the middle of the floor. The rest of the furniture was arranged round the walls.
   “What a delightful room, Lorrimer!” exclaimed Hamilton as he surveyed it.
   “Very pleasant this weather, sir,” the servant replied, “but a bit chilly in winter. There’s no fireplace, you see. Shall I unpack for you, sir?”
   “No, thanks, I’ll do it myself. What time is lunch?”
   “In half an hour, sir. Will that be all, then, sir?”
   Hamilton assured him that he wanted nothing else, and when Lorrimer had gone he unpacked his suitcase and distributed his belongings in the drawers of the great chest opposite the foot of the bed.
   The task completed, he washed his face and hands at the primitive wash-stand and, sitting in one of the window recesses, relit his pipe. He could see the irregular roof of the building below, and the other tower beyond, with behind it nothing but the sea. Everything was very still. London, with all its teeming millions, seemed infinitely remote: he could scarcely realize that he had left it only yesterday. Already it was like a bad dream in the morning. The charm of Kestrel settled over him in a golden cloud. All his fears had vanished. What Tony and his friends were doing would be explained presently, but everything was all right. All he had to do was to enjoy this short respite from the humdrum of his daily existence. How he envied his friend, able to stay in this enchanted spot for ever if he so desired!
   The faint note of a gong reached his ears, and he went down to lunch. He found Tony and the doctor awaiting him in the hall, and with them a fat and peculiarly unpleasant-looking man, who was introduced to him as Mr. Simon Vaughan. Cocktails were served by Johnston, Tony’s suave manservant, who recognized Hamilton and gave him a little bow. Then they went to lunch in the old dining-hall.
   This room, which lay at the back of the building, separated from the library by a passage leading from the hall to the servants’ quarters, had also been brought into use after old Sir Anthony’s death. It was nobly proportioned, with a high peaked roof and richly carved stone walls. The ancient east window, with its wonderful Crucifixion in stained glass, miraculously preserved almost intact through the centuries, instantly betrayed the original purpose of the chamber, and it gave Hamilton a queer feeling for a while, to sit there, eating and talking, in what had once been the holy of holies of the old monks. The feeling wore off gradually, however, and he was soon laughing with the rest at the doctor’s gay sallies. Vaughan’s conversation scintillated also, and Hamilton soon forgot the gross appearance of the man, as Tony had done long before.
   Chapter IX
   The same afternoon Tony and his friend went for a stroll down to the sheltered beach on the landward side of the island. Gaunt had told him that there was no necessity for further study that day, so that he and Hamilton could talk to their hearts’ content. They went down the stairway to the harbour, and then along a narrow path over the wall on to the beach. Finding a spot where the low cliff gave shelter from the sun, they sat on the warm, soft sand and watched the little waves breaking on the shore.
   For a while they talked of various unimportant things, of London, and mutual friends there, but at last Hamilton could contain himself no longer.
   “Look here, Tony,” he said, “exactly what’s going on here? What are you and Gaunt working so hard at, and what’s this fellow Vaughan up to?”
   Tony, his hands clasped round his knees, drew in a lungful of smoke before replying. Then he said:
   “Gaunt is teaching me the ancient wisdom, and Simon Vaughan is making his preparations for the ultimate expulsion of the curse.”
   “Oh! You believe in it now?”
   “Absolutely. John, there can be no shadow of doubt. There is something abominable hidden here, and I feel it my duty to put an end to it.”
   “Have you seen anything?”
   “No, but they have. They went down into the caves beneath the crypt one night when I was asleep and actually saw the thing.”
   “H’m. Beneath the crypt, eh? I thought you said there was nothing there in your letter.”
   “No, not in the crypt itself. But there is a way through the crypt altar into a perfect maze of tunnels and passages in the solid rock. I went down once, with Vaughan and Gaunt, but since it was before sunset we saw nothing, though we felt it, by Jove! It was awful. I was jolly glad to get out again.”
   “Felt it? How do you mean?”
   “A sort of beastly oppression and feeling of tension, as if something were being wound up. Gaunt said that if we had stayed a minute longer that we did it would have materialized. I’m very thankful we didn’t.”
   Hamilton looked thoughtful.
   “You certainly seem convinced that there is something out of the ordinary there,” said he. “Well, as you know, I’m no sceptic. I’m quite ready to admit that there may be things which science knows nothing of. I went to a séance once, out of pure curiosity, and some really extraordinary things happened, though I imagine that about seventy-five per cent of that sort of thing is trickery. Are you quite sure there’s nothing like that here?”
   “Who would gain anything by it? What good would it do? I suppose you mean Dr. Gaunt and his colleague. No, John, you can rule them out. They’re genuine. Gaunt’s shown me some amazing things; he has genuine power. He’s quite won me over to this way of thinking.”
   “So it seems. And what’s this ‘ancient wisdom’ he’s teaching you?”
   “He calls it ‘theurgic mysticism,’ or the occult philosophy. It is the hidden knowledge which has been handed down for countless ages by a chosen few.”
   “That sounds very fine, Tony, but knowledge of what?”
   “Knowledge of ourselves first, John, of the human mind and will, and the wonders which they can work. Then knowledge of the answer to the riddle of the Universe. You know, I’ve always lacked a purpose in life — something real to do. I’ve found it now. I’ve always wanted to know what Life was all about — what it all meant. I’m finding out now.”
   “Then I’m very glad, Tony. If this occult business helps you at all, carry on by all means. I know Gaunt’s a sound man, and you’ll come to no harm in his hands.”
   Tony’s face lit up with pleasure.
   “Oh, John. I’m so glad you feel like that about it!” he exclaimed. “I know you’re right. I couldn’t have a better teacher.”
   “How is he teaching you?”
   “First by training me in concentration. I have to spend hours a day — it was only a few minutes at first — just looking steadily at some object or other, and excluding everything else from my mind. It’s amazing how one improves with practice. At first I couldn’t keep my attention fixed for five minutes even — a host of vague thoughts kept intruding. Now I seem to get right inside the thing I’m meditating on, and see more in it than I ever saw before in a whole landscape. This month I’ve started learning to concentrate on ideas too — with no material object to help — that’s much more difficult.”
   Hamilton scratched the back of his hand with his chin.
   “It all sounds very interesting, Tony,” he said, “but where does it lead to?”
   “Simply to an increase of will-power — merely a means to an end. And when that end is achieved there’s scarcely any limit to the power of the human will.”
   “ ‘Man is not subject to the angels, nor to death utterly, save by the weakness of his own feeble will,’ ” quoted Hamilton. “That’s Poe, I fancy. Well, then, what? First this increase of volition, and afterwards…?
   “Afterwards the transcendental business — access to higher planes of being — ultimate union with Reality; mystical stuff, you know. However, all that will come later; it means years of work, but it’s immensely worth while, John.”
   “If you think so I suppose it must be. It sounds very much like common or garden mysticism to me, though, and I somehow hadn’t thought of you as quite the mystic type, Tony. It needs a tremendous lot of faith to go blindly into the dark like this. I’d have thought you’d wanted quicker results than the mystic way can give, and more certain knowledge of where you were going.”
   A little frown gathered on Tony’s face.
   “Oh, I don’t know about that,” he said; “I’m getting results already — small, but promising enough. And I shall get the knowledge all right when I’m initiated — “
   “Initiated!” exclaimed the other. “There is some sort of Order, then?”
   “Rather! Gaunt is Master of the London Chapter.”
   Hamilton whistled softly.
   “There’s more in this than I thought,” said he. “When will this initiation take place?”
   “Early next month.”
   “So soon?”
   “Yes. You see, Vaughan wants me to have some sort of idea about this occult business so that I can help him destroy the curse. And he wants to do that on September 25th.”
   “Why?”
   “That is the anniversary of the day upon which the Abbot first pronounced the curse. Apparently it is particularly suitable.”
   “Well,” said Hamilton, “that sounds reasonable. But tell me, Tony, aren’t you ever scared of all this business you’re letting yourself in for? It’s so unlike what I’ve ever known of you in the past. You’ve never taken anything so seriously before.”
   “I know, John. That’s been my trouble: never could take anything seriously. Well, this is serious: deadly serious. I’ve got to smash the curse. I feel that I am the one to set Kestrel free. The only way I can do it is by learning all I can of the inner workings of such matters, and then putting myself freely into the hands of a real expert like Vaughan.”
   “But that is not your only reason for taking up these occult studies? You are fascinated by the whole thing?”
   “Not altogether, John. It is fascinating, of course, but then it promises unlimited knowledge and power.”
   “I’m not at all sure that they are desirable, Tony.” Hamilton’s voice was quiet, but very serious. “I don’t want to damp you ardour, but I suppose you know what all this would have been called a couple of hundred years ago?”
   “Yes, John. I know what you’re going to say. Magic, wasn’t it? Odd how the word has deteriorated. Nowadays it means sleight-of-hand and conjuring tricks. Rabbits from top-hats. Then it meant — what? All power and all knowledge. It’s a big thing, John.”
   There was a long silence after Tony had finished speaking, while the two friends sat, not looking at each other, but gazing across the sea to the distant Cornish coast. Overhead a gull slid by on motionless wings. All else was still as a painted picture in the hot sunlight.
   When Tony broke the silence his voice was almost timid:
   “John, does it interest you at all? I mean — would you care to join me? Have you never wanted anything more from life than just — just living?”
   Hamilton smiled, and, taking his pipe from his mouth, knocked it out on a stone.
   “Just living is good enough for me, Tony,” he said. “But then I’m differently made from you. I have, I suppose, some sort of artistic sense, insight — call it what you will. At all events I can see beneath the surface of life to a certain extent, and feel the grand adventure of it all; the golden glory of success; the exquisite pain of ecstasy; the quiet peace of happiness; the blood-red, royal road of agony.
   “I have seen something of the heroism which goes on continually in other people’s lives — in the struggles of the very poor, the repressed, the aged, the forgotten. I try, in my humble way, to set down on paper a record of these things, that other people may see with my eyes the things they cannot see for themselves. Whether I succeed or not is quite another matter, but the effort is there. My cup of life is full to the brim, Tony. I have no room for anything more. And when I have drained it to the dregs I will face the last and greatest adventure of all with a quiet mind.”
   Tony was deeply impressed by Hamilton’s words, but all he said was:
   “You are very fortunate, John. I have never experienced these things — never even seen them in others. Certainly I have no purpose like yours — at least, I hadn’t at one time. I have one now, but it seems very remote from your own. Must our paths lie apart now, John? I’m sorry.”
   “I’m sorry too, Tony. There is no reason why we should not be friends, in spite of our different motives. One last question, though: do you believe in God?”
   Tony looked sharply at his friend, a queerly puzzled expression in his eyes.
   “I suppose so,” he answered hesitantly; “I’ve never really thought about it much.”
   “Then your new faith does not teach you such belief?”
   “No. We know that there are vast impersonal forces which can be tapped by the human will; we know that there is an order in the Universe; but we don’t exactly worship a personal God. We strive rather, by analogy and symbolism, as well as by direct mystical approach, to achieve union with the Ultimate Reality which lies behind the material world.”
   “I suspected as much. That’s another point, then, upon which I differ from you. I think I do believe in God. I met an old priest yesterday — “
   “What a delightful spot for a chat!” broke in the cheerful voice of Gaunt. The doctor was standing at the edge of the low cliff above them, having presumably walked down one of the overland paths from the Abbey instead of coming down the stairway to the harbour.
   “Have you finished gossiping?” he went on. “The tea-bell went nearly half an hour ago, and we thought you must be lost.”
   The two friends laughed, and clambered up to him, and all three went back to the Abbey together.
   When Hamilton lay in bed that night, smoking a last pipe before blowing out the candle, he reviewed the events of the day. Though from a purely logical point of view he found himself bound to admit that he found no fault with Tony’s new studies, yet his soul instinctively rebelled against them. The spectacle of his young friend, once so gay and carefree, delving into these great mysteries, with the weight of his newly acquired knowledge showing clearly on his strangely altered countenance, distressed him in spite of himself. He had no suspicions of Gaunt, though Vaughan’s place in the picture did not seem too clearly defined. If the curse really existed — a point upon which Hamilton still entertained grave doubts — and if Vaughan was able to deal with it effectively, why must Tony be dragged into it at all? If, as Tony said, his help was essential, and he must have this occult training before he could render that help, why was Vaughan’s presence necessary? Tony himself had said that Gaunt was the Superior of the Order to which presumably Vaughan belonged also, and consequently must be possessed of morepower than his colleague. The whole thing didn’t quite fit.
   What was he to do? That was the question. True, he had agreed with Tony on the beach that afternoon that their ways must lie apart in future, but he could not reconcile himself to abandoning his friend at what appeared to be a great spiritual crisis of some sort. If he were to leave Tony alone with these two occultists, studying their faith, then the issue would not be in doubt: Tony would infallibly go through with the whole affair, be‘initiated’ — whatever that might entail — and become irrevocably one of them. Even if he changed his mind at the last moment, and wished to draw back, he could hardly be expected to resist the persuasion of the two of them alone. But if he, Hamilton, were to stay on for a while, however unwelcome he might be, Tony would at least have someone of his own kind to turn to, if the need arose.
   Having reached this decision, Hamilton knocked the ashes from his pipe, blew out the candle, and, after watching the moonlight falling through one of his four windows for a while, fell asleep.
   An hour later Gaunt opened the door of Vaughan’s room and slipped quietly in. His colleague, looking bigger than ever in a dressing-gown of blue silk, was sitting at the small table beside his bed, an open book before him. He raised his eyes from the page he was reading and watched the doctor draw up a chair and sit down opposite him. Without a word he drew a cigar-case from his pocket and offered it to the other. When both had lit one of the thin cheroots apiece, and the blue smoke was curling up over the chimney of the lamp, the doctor spoke.
   “Well, Simon, this is rather awkward,” he said.
   “Hamilton, you mean?” Vaughan did not trouble to remove his cigar when he spoke, and his thick red lips scarcely moved, slurring the words.
   “Precisely. We cannot continue our plan satisfactorily with him here. Apart from the obvious difficulty of finding time for young Lovell to continue his studies, with his friend to entertain, it is very probable that Hamilton’s presence would have the effect of distracting his mind to such an extent that I should be unable to keep him in the withdrawn state necessary for initiation.”
   “Then Hamilton must go.”
   “Just so, but the question is, how?”
   “Destruction?” Vaughan passed his tongue over his lips, rolling his cheroot from one side to the other.
   “I think not. It would mean an enormous expenditure of power, and the Outer Darkness is too close for that. It would be dangerous. Besides, we could hardly effect it without arousing Lovell’s suspicions.”
   “Then we must drive him out.” There was a shade of disappointment in Vaughan’s tone.
   “That is my opinion. But I wanted your confirmation, and now your help.”
   “That is always at your service, Doctor.”
   “I hope so. I don’t think we could frighten him away, do you?”
   “Definitely not. It would only increase his resistance if we tried, and if we succeeded in truly alarming him he would take Lovell with him, willing or no.”
   “Yes,” agreed the doctor, “I, too, am afraid of that. He must believe that by going away alone he is serving his friend’s interests.”
   “Simple suggestion, then.”
   “I doubt its efficacy in his case. For one untrained he has an abnormally strong will. It is a difficult problem, Simon.”
   There was an interval of silence, during which they puffed away at their cheroots. Gaunt spoke again:
   “I see nothing else for it. Direct attack upon Hamilton himself is impossible, under the circumstances. Lovell himself must go to him and ask him to leave.”
   “He’ll never do that.”
   “No, he’s far too courteous and hospitable to do it consciously.”
   “But you must not hypnotize him, Doctor! It would destroy all the strength his will has gained during the past months. You cannot undo your work like that.”
   “I don’t propose to, Simon. He is asleep now, I should imagine. We can easily find out. If so, I can withdraw his astral shell without touching the consciousness or harming the will.”
   “I have never known it to be done, Doctor.”
   “There are many things you do not know, my friend. This happens to be one of them. Now get your crystal.”
   Obediently Vaughan heaved himself up and rummaged in a trunk until he found the fellow to the crystal Gaunt had used to summon him to Kestrel. He sat down again, placing it on the table between them. Gaunt carefully oriented the inscribed base of the crystal and, laying his arms on either side of it, took Vaughan’s hands in his. They both gazed into the faintly gleaming sphere.
   Presently it began to glow with an interior light, and the doctor said in a low voice:
   “Yes, Simon, he is asleep. Now join your will with mine. Nothing more. I will do the rest.”
   The silence in the room grew deeper, and the crystal glowed more fiercely, until it seemed like a ball of liquid fire. Gaunt slowly turned his head, looking away from the sphere towards an empty corner of the room. Vaughan followed his eyes, and saw, against the bare stone wall, a shadow forming. Denser and denser it grew, until the stones in the wall were hidden, then suddenly it was the form of a man: the form of Tony Lovell. The phantasm was identical in every detail— even to the exotic pyjamas — with the figure which still lay sleeping in a room not far distant; but there was no mind behind the blue eyes blankly regarding them.
   Used as he was to manifestations of the supernormal, Vaughan could not suppress a faint shudder, and the short hairs on his fat neck bristled. Gaunt spoke:
   “Go to John Hamilton’s room, walking up the stairs as a man would walk, but softly. Wake him, and speak to him as I shall command. Go!”
   Obediently the phantasm turned and went out through the door. The bare feet padded along the gallery floor. Gaunt turned back to the crystal.
   Hamilton was sleeping quietly when he felt somebody shaking him violently. Drowsily he opened his eyes, to see, as he thought, Tony Lovell bending over him, clear in the bright moonlight.
   “John, wake up! I want to talk to you.”
   “What a ghastly hour to choose for a chat!” Hamilton sat up, rubbing his eyes and yawning cavernously. “‘Can’t it wait till morning?”
   “No, John, it’s vitally important.” ‘Tony’ sat on the edge of the bed.
   “Oh, all right, Tony. But make it snappy!”
   “I will. Look, John, you know I’d love to have you here for as long as you like to stay?”
   “Yes, I know you would. But not now, is that it?”
   “Yes. You see, the job I’m doing now is terribly important. It’s the biggest thing I’ve ever undertaken, and I want to make a go of it.”
   “I understand, Tony.”
   “I knew you would. And old Gaunt’s put in a tremendous lot of time with me. I can’t let him down. You see, I must finish my preliminary training, and be initiated well before the twenty-fifth of next month, as I told you this afternoon. It means hours of work every day — I couldn’t even entertain you as I’d like to — and do this job as well. I wouldn’t have the time.”
   “Yes, I see now, Tony. Of course I’ll clear out tomorrow. We’re old enough pals to be able to be frank with each other, and I’m glad you told me.”
   “It’s awfully decent of you, John, but I knew you’d see my point. One other thing: don’t mention this little talk of ours tomorrow. Gaunt’d be furious if he knew I’d asked you not to stay on account of him. He’s an awfully decent blighter.”
   “Okay, Tony, mum’s the word. Good luck, old son.”
   “Thanks, John. Good night.”
   “Good night, Tony.”
   And that which was not Tony went quietly out as Hamilton turned over and went to sleep again.
   On the floor below the two necromancers were still sitting, staring into their crystal, when the phantasm re-entered and stood motionless by the door. Gaunt addressed it:
   “That was well done. Now go back to your abode, silently, as you came.”
   The figure lost its sharp outlines, softened, blurred, became a shadow, and suddenly was not. The light in the crystal dwindled and faded. Gaunt stood up.
   “I fancy that settles that problem, Simon” he said.
   At the breakfast-table, some hours later, Hamilton announced his intention of leaving Kestrel and continuing his walking tour in Cornwall. Since Gaunt was present he did not refer to his supposed talk with Tony during the night, but apologized for changing his plans so suddenly.
   Tony, taken quite by surprise, for he was fully expecting his friend to stay at the Abbey for some time, looked quickly across at the doctor, as if for advice. That gentleman nodded almost imperceptibly, and Tony took this to mean that he was to let Hamilton go without argument. Indeed, he was not sorry to do so, for he had been greatly troubled in his mind at the conflict between loyalty to his friend and devotion to his new ideals, though he himself would never have dreamed of precipitating the issue in this manner.
   So it came about that, later the same day, Tregellis sat at the tiller of the launch, with Hamilton and his suitcase on board, heading for Pentock. Gaunt had seen to it that Tony had had no opportunity for private conversation with his friend— he was taking no chances — and all three came down to the little harbour to see him off. The farewells were very cheerful and hearty, but Hamilton could not suppress a queer little feeling of remorse as the landing-stage and its waving figures retreated and were lost from view behind the jutting rock. Was he doing right, leaving Tony thus? Time alone would tell.
   He lay that night at the Three Fishermen, Pentock.
   Chapter X
   I
   John Hamilton was climbing the steep path leading to the village church. It was only six o’clock, and the morning was delightfully cool and fresh. The sun was shining brightly, but there was still a slight mist on the sea, a presage of the heat to come.
   He had not forgotten the rector’s last words to him, and he was going to renew his acquaintance with a faith which the years had dimmed. It was strange, he thought, how quickly one forgot those things which once had seemed so important. As a boy he had been a devoted church-goer, a regular communicant. He had been an altar-server at a famous London Anglo-Catholic church, with all the enthusiasm of youth for ceremonial and the outward side of that particular brand of Christianity. He realized that his faith could not have gone very much beyond the externals, or he would not have lost touch the way he had, engrossed with his work, and the new life he had perforce to adopt when his parents died, both within a period of weeks. Anyhow, he would give the thing a trial, and see if there were really anything in it to awaken the old enthusiasm. At least he could differentiate now between aesthetic appeal and true devotion.
   The bell began to peal as he pushed open the lychgate and entered the churchyard. It was not a beautiful bell— indeed, it resembled nothing so much as the beating of a tin can — but the sound seemed oddly fraught with deep significance. The church itself had no pretensions to exterior beauty either, being a long oblong, somewhat flat in the pitch of the roof, with a squat tower at the west end. It wasbuilt of the local granite, which does not lend itself to rich sculpture, and the only break in the horizontal lines was a little porch beneath the tower, by which Hamilton entered.
   Once inside, he paused uncertainly, for the place was uncommonly dark after the brilliant morning light, but his eyes soon accustomed themselves to the gloom, and he slipped hastily into a near-by pew and knelt down. A prayer came unbidden to his lips, and before he knew it he was making the old familiar preparation for communion, the first time for more years that he liked to remember.
   When he had finished he lifted his head and looked about him. Yes, there it all was, just as he had known it in the years gone by: the Stations of the Cross upon the walls; the rood-beam, with its great crucifix and attendant figures; the elaborately decorated sanctuary; the High Altar, surmounted by six tall candles; the statues, with their votive lamps. Even the faint odour of incense was familiar. It was like coming home. Sternly warning himself against sentimentality, Hamilton sat back on his pew and continued his observations.
   The plain parallelogram of the exterior was repeated within the building, but it was brought into proportion by the beautiful chancel screen of elvan stone which divided it. There was no east window— a fact which accounted for a good deal of the gloom — but a magnificently carved reredos set off the perfectly proportioned altar. It was evident that no effort had been spared to make the little church a veritable gem of beauty. Hamilton remembered the rector’s admission that he was a poorman, and guessed that his purse had furnished most of the decoration.
   On the south side of the nave, against the chancel screen, a little altar had been contrived, on which stood the curtained Tabernacle, with its white lamp. Remembering That which dwelt therein, the young man fell upon his knees once more, overwhelmed by a great wave of devotion which came sweeping up out of the past.
   “Adoremus in æternum Sanctissimum Sacramentum.”
   The words came trembling to his lips. How could he ever have forgotten, ever doubted? Here, after all, was reality.
   Two or three of the villagers came in, and the boy who was pulling the bell-rope by the font abandoned his task and walked quickly up the aisle, going into the tiny vestry, from which he presently emerged to light two of the altar-candles with a taper. Then he returned to the vestry, coming back a moment later with the missal in his hands, followed by the rector, vested, and bearing the sacred vessels. They made a reverence to the altar, and the Mass began.
   When it was over, Hamilton remained on his knees, lost in wonder. His critical sense quite gone, he had been caught up once more in the tremendous drama of the great act of sacrifice, and swept unresisting into the very heart of faith. The hard shell of worldliness which had grown around his heart was broken, and he was a child again. Deep humility filled his whole being, and a devout thankfulness for the mercy which had led him, all unknowing, to this place. There were tears in his eyes as he lifted his head, to find the rector, now in his threadbare cassock, standing beside him.
   “Good morning, Mr. Hamilton,” said the old man. “Will you join me at breakfast?”
   Collecting himself, the other thanked him, and together they passed out into the dazzling sunshine.
   From the churchyard a little gate led into the rectory garden, and within a couple of minutes they were sitting in the dining-room of the old house, the rector pouring out coffee, while his housekeeper bustled about the table.
   “You are soon back, Mr. Hamilton,” he remarked.
   “Yes, Father. It seemed that I had arrived at an inopportune moment. Tony is at a vital point in his new studies, so as soon as I decently could I came away.”
   The rector raised his eyebrows.
   “What studies?” he asked.
   “Dr. Gaunt is teaching him some kind of occult business — theurgic mysticism was the term, I think. It’s apparently necessary that he should be able to assist Vaughan with the expulsion of the curse, and he must know what to do.”
   “I don’t quite like the sound of that,” said the priest slowly. “He is taking it very seriously, then?”
   “Yes, he seems quite wrapped up in it. Talks of a new life, and so on.”
   “He is accepting this occult teaching as a philosophy of life, I take it, and not simply as a means to an end?”
   “Evidently. They plan to attack the curse on the day of its anniversary — September 25th— but Tony talks of years of study after his initiation.”
   “Ah!” The rector laid down his knife and fork and leaned forward. “Initiation, eh? Into what, I wonder?”
   “There is apparently a secret society, or Order, of which Gaunt is the head in this country, which preserves this mysterious ancient wisdom,” Hamilton explained.
   The old man shook his head.
   “It’s a sad thing, Mr. Hamilton,” he said, “the way some people turn to these outlandish beliefs as an escape from reality, when the Church can show them how to comprehend reality. This very human desire toknow has been the undoing of many a man, simply through his getting on the wrong road to knowledge.”
   “Then there really is something in this occultist stuff, Father?”
   “Oh yes, there’s a great deal in it. It has haunted mankind since the world first began. Forbidden fruit, you know. The Serpent in Eden. It was enshrined in the faith of Egypt; it was the whole of the mystery religions which flourished around the Mediterranean. It has troubled Christianity for centuries; the Gnostic heresy, the Christian Cabalists, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Rosicrucians — all professed to have this secret knowledge. And still it goes on.”
   “But is there any real harm in it, Father? It’s only make-believe, surely? Just bringing about an abnormal state of mind by an effort of will: purely subjective.”
   “I’m not at all sure about that, Mr. Hamilton. The limitless power of the human will has always been acknowledged. You will remember Our Lord’s words: ‘If ye had faith, so much as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say to yonder mountain, Be thou removed hence, and cast into the sea, and it would be so’? “
   “Yes, but I always thought that was just a figure of speech.”
   “That’s the general comment on Christ’s words, isn’t it? Figures of speech not meant to be taken literally. ‘This is My Body’: figure of speech, say you! But I know that the substance of the bread which I consecrated on yonder altar an hour ago was annihilated, and became the very substance of the Godhead bodily. Do you believe that, Mr. Hamilton?”
   “Yes, Father, I do.” Hamilton’s voice was humble. “But this is different, surely?”
   “How different? If I, having been consecrated a priest, can perform a miracle, why should not these others, by means of ancient formulae and systems, be also able to perform miracles: lesser ones than that, naturally, but miraculous, nevertheless?”
   “But that would be magic, Father.”
   “Well, what of it? There’s magic everywhere. By ritual words and gestures water is made holy, a man is made a priest, bread is made God. That’s Divine magic — or, more strictly, grace. But there is a lesser kind also. I tell you, Mr. Hamilton, that the spirit of magic was never more widespread than it is today: Christian Science, Spiritualism, Menticulture, Couéism — all magic. Even Lourdes, Loretto, and our own Walsingham effect their cures by a process akin to magic.”
   Hamilton rubbed his chin.
   “I’d never thought of it like that,” he admitted. “I must say it sounds very feasible.”
   “It is feasible. But don’t misunderstand me. Your real magician, your true Hermetic philosopher, though he may be able to effect material results, does not study his books, and train his will, merely to perform vulgar marvels. He leaves that to the conjurer on the variety stage. No, his is a real science of life, a perpetual striving to blend the macrocosm with the microcosm, to plumb all the mysteries of nature by attaining higher planes of being. That’s the mystic way.”
   “But there were Catholic mystics, Father.”
   “Of course: St. Theresa, St. John of the Cross, and countless more. But theirs was not the way of magic. They always endeavoured to pass the plane upon which the magician works — the astral plane, I think they call it — going higher and ever higher, until at last they achieved union with the ultimate reality, God Himself. No, my son, the real danger of magic is that it leads to egotism, and arrogant pride of one’s own knowledge and power. Seeking after the many, it forgets the One. It strives to know instead of to be. What said Eliphas Levi, perhaps the greatest of the Hermetic philosophers? ‘Too deep a study of the mysteries of nature may estrange from God the careless investigator, in whom mental fatigue paralyses the ardour of the heart.’ And Levi became a Catholic at the last, you know.”
   “I’m afraid I know very little of these things, Father.”
   “The less the better, my son. Tell me, what manner of man is this Nicholas Gaunt?”
   They had finished breakfast, and were sitting smoking Hamilton’s tobacco. The latter thought for a while before replying; then:
   “He’s a charming man, Father. Brilliant; tremendous will-power; amazing knowledge of practically any subject. A fascinating character. Kindly, too, or appears to be. I think he’s honest, and is really fond of Tony.
   “H’m. He’s evidently made a good impression on you, at all events. I must confess I liked what I saw of him at the funeral. And this friend of his, Simon Vaughan — he doesn’t seem to have impressed the Dykes much, from all accounts.”
   “No, he strikes one as rather repulsive at first sight. He’s a short, enormously fat chap; flabby, you know. Head like a toad, rather: bald and flat. Small eyes, with heavy lids. Thick red lips that scarcely move when he speaks, slurring his words. But after you’ve been talking to him for a while he is so polished and delightful that you soon forget his appearance and think what a fool you were to notice it.”
   “A brilliant description, Mr. Hamilton. It stamps you as a journalist. I knew a man like this Vaughan once: a Roman priest he was. But in his case it was his outward appearance that gave the measure of the man after all, for he came to a sticky end, I remember. An unpleasant scandal — he was unfrocked.”
   Hamilton looked sharply at the priest’s calm face.
   “This couldn’t be the same, I suppose?” he asked anxiously.
   “Not the least chance, Mr. Hamilton. That was — what — forty years ago, and he was a man of over sixty. How old is this Vaughan?”
   Hamilton could barely suppress a sigh of relief.
   “Not more than fifty.”
   They sat smoking in silence for a while. Then Hamilton spoke again.
   “I suppose there’s nothing we can do about it, Father. I hate leaving Tony to his own devices, but there it is.”
   “What are your plans, my son?”
   “I shall continue my holiday, walking up the coast. I’ve never been farther north than here.”
   “This coast is very grand — more rugged altogether than in the south. You’ll get plenty of scenery. Where will you make for?”
   “I want to get as far as Tintagel if I can. Arthur’s Castle, you know.”
   The rector smiled.
   “Still the romantic, eh? It was a sorry ruin when I saw it last, and I should imagine it’s worse now. Most of the castle has fallen down the cliff. If I were you I would take the coast road to Crantock — the church there is very fine. Cut out Newquay — it will be swarming now — and make for Padstow; they’ve dug up an ancient chapel at St. Enodoc that’s worth a visit. Cross the Camel at Wadebridge, and follow the moorland road to Tintagel. It’s worth pushing on to Boscastle if you’ve time — there’s a lovely valley, and a curious towerless church near by. Then a bit farther on is High Cliff, the highest point on the whole coast.”
   “Hold hard, Father,” Hamilton laughed. “You’ll have me at Bristol at this rate.”
   “Sorry, Mr. Hamilton. My enthusiasm ran away with me. I love this country — I only wish I could come with you.”
   “So do I, Father. Well, I must be off.”
   “Shall you come back this way?”
   “Yes, I’ll leave my bag at the Three Fishermen, and take a haversack. I’ll come back by rail from Camelford or Otterham and pick it up.”
   “Come and see me, won’t you?”
   “Rather! Thanks so much for everything, Father. Good-bye!”
   “Good-bye, my boy. God speed!”
   They shook hands, and Hamilton made his way back to the inn. He had come prepared for this eventuality, and had packed an empty haversack, so that it was only a matter of transferring such necessities as he would require, and in less than an hour he had made his arrangements with the landlord and set off.
   He had borrowed a sturdy ash-plant, his flask and sandwiches were in his pocket, and in spite of the heat, which was still great— although the sky had clouded over since the early morning — it was infinitely better than London, and he was glad to be free for a while. By evening a fine mist of rain was falling, but Hamilton still strode on, delighting in the coolness it brought. Dusk was falling when he reached Crantock and found a lodging for the night.
   II
   For two days after his friend’s departure Tony was vaguely distressed over his loss, for he could not regard their parting as other than a clean break between his old life and the new, but, having once set his hand to the plough, he was determined not to turn back, and threw himself into his studies with more vigour than ever before. The doctor was highly delighted with his pupil’s progress, and promised him initiation within three weeks. Every day they worked from breakfast until dinner, taking a short as time as possible over meals, and every day Tony felt his grasp of the tremendous subject he had undertaken strengthening. His will-power deepened amazingly, and before long he was able to induce a state of auto-hypnosis, and reach the astral plane unaided. But his mentor did not permit such excursions often, telling him that he must conserve his spiritual energy for the great act of initiation.
   After dinner, and before going to bed, they usually relaxed, and passed the time in conversation, when Vaughan would join them. The latter spent most of his days down in the crypt, and once Tony asked if he might see what he was doing there.
   After a preliminary visit, alone, Gaunt took him down the narrow spiral stair.
   Two of the vapour-lamps from the hall had been taken down, and stood on the altar, casting a brilliant pool of light in the midst of the gloomy place. In the circle of radiance Vaughan was working, crouched upon the stone floor, measuring distances with a surveyor’s tape. As they approached Tony could see the outlines of an immense and elaborate diagram, traced in multi-coloured paints, on the stone floor of the crypt, around the altar. Vaughan stood up, and his grotesque shadow, now gigantic, added to the weirdness of the scene.
   “Come, Sir Anthony,” he said, as Tony hovered uncertainly in the shadows, “you can walk on it without fear, now. It is not yet charged with force.”
   Tony advanced, scanning the ground with deep interest. He was now well versed in the mysteries of diagram and symbolism, but this design was quite new to him. It appeared to consist of a series of concentric circles, radiating from the altar, with a number of pentagonal figures superimposed. Characters, some of which he recognized as Hebrew and Greek, were inscribed at various points.
   “It is beautifully done, Mr. Vaughan,” he said, “but what is it for?”
   Vaughan laughed, well pleased with the praise.
   “For our great work, Sir Anthony, the banishment of the curse monstrosity, and the deliverance of this island and yourself from its bondage. The doctor will explain it all to you in good time.”
   With that Tony had perforce to be content. As he followed the converging lines to the altar he observed that that also had been embellished with coloured symbols, and that the top was sealed down with broad white tapes, the ends of which were attached to the stone with great blobs of red wax.
   “That is to prevent any interference from the monstrosity while I am at work,” Vaughan explained. “It is probably aware that we are planning its destruction, and it might well endeavour to prevent us.”
   It says much for Gaunt’s tuition that Tony accepted this explanation without surprise, and presently went back to his books, leaving the doctor with Vaughan. When the echo of the young man’s footsteps upon the stairs had died away the latter said:
   “You have done well, Doctor. He questions nothing. Our task should be easy.”
   Gaunt smiled grimly.
   “Don’t be too sure, my friend. It is the initiation I am afraid of. When he finds out the truth he may well become intractable. I am so concerned that I have decided to summon a meeting of the brotherhood, and take him up to London for the ceremony.”
   “But I thought it was to be done here, Doctor. If you can’t initiate him, no one can.”
   “True, Simon. But I think the effect of the mass-suggestion of the brethren is likely to prove most valuable in this case. It will lessen the chances of a relapse. We can go up by road, and thus avoid the distraction of a train journey.”
   “And afterwards?”
   “We shall return here, and continue the work.”
   “He will be agreeable?”
   “He will not know any more than is absolutely necessary, Simon. Once he has assisted at the Mass, and committed the ultimate sacrilege, I shall trap him into making an act of renunciation, and control of the monstrosity will pass to me.”
   “And then?”
   “Then he can go. I shall have no more use for him. I doubt if he will desire to assist the consummation; he will never be a really useful member of our Order; he has not the inclination.”
   “No, I agree with you there, Doctor. I fear he will always lean towards the good. A pity!”
   “As you say, Simon, a pity. I have grown to like him. However, such trifles must not stand in the way of our plan. Once that is in operation, nothing will matter very much anymore.”
   “It terrifies me sometimes, Doctor; it is so vast, so overwhelming.”
   “It is the ultimate triumph, Simon.”
   “I know, but supposing anything were to go wrong?”
   “Nothing can go wrong; trust in me. As soon as I have control over the monstrosity I shall sever the link which binds it to this place and loose it upon the world. Think of it, Simon! That thing is a concentration of pure evil, and sentient at that. It is as different from an ordinary elemental as the sun is from a candle-flame; there is no one power of evil in the world with a tithe of its strength; it is unique. And it has been lying here fermenting, as it were, for more than a thousand years; feeding on the life-stream of the wretched Lovells for the last four hundred. It must have acquired quite a taste for human souls — but I fancy it would welcome a variety. Satan! What will it not do when it is released?” He laughed horribly, and paused for a moment, reveling in the prospect. Then he went on:
   “But quite apart from that aspect of its release, Simon, it will upset the balance of power in this world, which, as you know, has been slightly in favour of the good for some two thousand years. We shall immediately and irrevocably gain the ascendancy for which we have been struggling for so long, and mankind will be delivered into our hands. What then? First the moral downfall — that should please you, Simon — all codes will become meaningless, and pleasure the only goal. Next, I suppose that civilization will collapse — it is but a frail edifice even now — and anarchy and barbarism will return to power. Ultimately mankind will sink to the level of the beasts; lower, even, for man will still retain his gift, or curse, as it will be in those days, of self-knowledge and free-will; and, knowing all the while what he is doing, he will plunge ever deeper into the pit.”
   Vaughan, who had seated himself on one of the trunks near by and lit a cheroot, asked:
   “And what will the end be, Doctor?”
   Gaunt walked lightly up the altar steps, turned, and stood with his back to the stone. The lamps on either side threw strange shadows on his pale face, and made the white streaks in his hair seem like little tongues of fire.
   “That even I cannot tell you, Simon,” he said. “It may be that in the pit mankind may find our Lord, and that he may lift them up again, and make of this earth such a home of intelligent evil as will be a menace to the Universe. It may be that out of this thing we do will spring the beginningof the end of Light itself. How long have you been with us, Simon?”
   “Forty years, Doctor.”
   “Before that you were a priest — one of them?”
   Vaughan’s face hardened, and his thick lips twisted.
   “Yes. They cast me out. I swore to repay them a thousandfold for the humiliation I endured.” His tone was bitter as death.
   “What have you achieved since you joined our ranks?” Gaunt went on. “You have said the Black Mass many times, profaning your old faith. That soothed your wounded pride, no doubt. But have we really advanced at all these forty years?”
   “A little, Doctor, surely. We have won many souls from them. What of the Great War? And then Spain, and China, and the continual threat of another world conflict. All our doing; Darkness is spreading slowly.”
   “Slowly, yes. Too slowly! They are at work as well; their inmost fortresses have not fallen. There are still some six hundred million souls who acknowledge Christ as Lord, and countless more who turn unknowingly towards the Light. The brethren of the right-hand path go forward also, Simon. There is more goodwill on earth today than there ever was. But here at last is our greatest opportunity since Calvary. We must not fail! At one stroke the battle can be won. Do you realize, Simon, that, quite apart from simply loosing this monstrosity upon the world, I could, if I desired, reopen the breach in the Veil and let the Darkness in?”
   “Doctor!” Vaughan sprang erect, his face chalk-white. “You would not do that! It would mean — the end.”
   “Exactly. The end of all life as we know it. The end of Light, and the beginning of eternal Darkness.”
   “Chaos once again!” Vaughan’s lips shook so that he could scarcely frame the words. “But, Doctor, what of us? We too should perish — we should never enjoy the fruits of our labour. Are we not worthy of our reward? Be content to liberate this horror; it will wreak desolation enough; it will quench all the will to good there ever was, and we shall se the victory.”
   “Oh, Simon, Simon! Must you always think of your wretched self? Can you not sink your ego for the Cause? I must admit I would rather carry out our original plan; I shall do so if all goes well. But, Simon, I fear Intervention.”
   “There has been no direct Intervention for more than nineteen hundred years. Why should you fear it now?”
   “Because the release of this monstrosity, and the victory of Darkness in this world, may have repercussions throughout the whole Universe. It might even be the beginning of the end. And so I feel that we may be prevented; I am practically certain we are being watched already; and the Powers who govern the rotation of the Eighth Sphere may take it upon themselves to move against us.”
   “Master, I beg of you — “ Vaughan’s voice trembled with terror.
   “Silence!” Gaunt sprang down the altar steps and stood towering over the other, his face, contorted with sudden fury, truly fiendish in the half-light.
   “I have warned you before, Simon; obstruct my path again and I will cast you into the Abyss without hesitation. My mind is made up: I shall proceed with our original plans for the release of the monstrosity, but at the least sign of outside interference I shall rend the Veil.”
   Vaughan cowered.
   “Very well, master. I will not attempt to dissuade you further, but if aught goes amiss, remember that I warned you.”
   “I will remember — everything. Proceed with the diagram, and let us have no more words.”
   The doctor stalked away and went up the spiral stair, while his colleague bent once more to his arduous task, albeit with many a sigh, and some shaking of the head.
   Chapter XI
   One morning, less than a fortnight after his visit to the crypt, Tony was overjoyed by Gaunt’s announcement that he was now ready for initiation, and that accordingly they would proceed to London on the morrow.
   During the remainder of that day the doctor carefully coached his willing pupil in the actual ceremony— at least, in such portions of it in which he would be required to play an active part; teaching him the formal responses to the questions he would be asked, and impressing him with the solemnity of the vows which he would take. Certain phases of the ritual, he told him, were absolutely secret, and must not be divulged beforehand.
   The hours flew by, but after he was in bed that night Tony lay awake for a long time, staring into the darkness, far too excited by the prospect of his approaching ordeal to sleep at once.
   At last it was at hand, he thought, the long-awaited fulfilment of his dreams; the greatest moment of his life so far; this first decisive step along his chosen path. Feeling himself to be upon the threshold of a new life, he looked back for a moment at the way he had come, and was aghast. Until his father’s death he had been a selfish young hedonist, spending his days in folly and the ceaseless search for pleasure. During those years in London he had been the ringleader of a group of “bright young things”, whose watchword had been distraction, anything for a fresh thrill. He had had dozens oflove-affairs of no importance, hundreds of friendships of no account. The only hours that seemed in retrospect to have been at all worth while were those he had spent with John Hamilton. Why the older man should have troubled with him at all had always been something of a mystery, after their firstcasual acquaintanceship — the result of a chance recognition of their common Varsity colours. Tony supposed that Hamilton must have sensed the desperate loneliness which he had generally managed to conceal beneath a mask of gaiety.
   Now he had parted for ever from that one true friend, and was following down another path a new life, alone. Yet not quite alone— the face of Nicholas Gaunt, strong and wise, kindly and steadfast, rose in his mind. Here was another friend, to whom he was bound, and would soon be bound even more closely, by the ties of common experience and secret knowledge shared.
   Next he thought of his parents— of his mother, dead these five years. How often she must have sorrowed over his youthful follies and aimless existence. And his father, who had thought so little of him that, when his wife died, he had come alone to Kestrel. How happy those last few weeks had been, when the two had been reunited, before the old man’s tragic end.
   He remembered his father’s last solemn charge — the trust he had placed in his son’s hands — to keep the curse of Kestrel from the world. How infinitely better than that he hoped to do! To banish it for ever from the face of earth. How proud his parents must be if they could see their son now! Never again would heshame their memory.
   Tony turned his eyes away from the sorry sight of the wasted years behind and set his face steadfastly towards the future, still half hidden in a veil of mystery, but soon to be revealed in all its glowing wonder of knowledge, power, and limitless experience. Rapt in ecstasy, he fell asleep.
   After an early breakfast the three crossed to Pentock in the launch. Lorrimer had been told to expect them back within three days. He had seemed surprised when his young master told him of the proposed journey to London“on business”, and had seemed on the point of making some observation, but had checked himself, and bowed in silence. Sitting in the rapidly moving boat, Tony wondered vaguely what could have been in the old servant’s mind, but he soon forgot the incident.
   The sea was choppy and the sky overcast, but the voyage was accomplished in less than an hour. They had no luggage, save a dressing-case apiece, and made their way to the inn as soon as they had disembarked. Dykes, the landlord, led them through the yard to the stable where the cars were kept, and unlocking the door, helped to roll the great Bentley out. Rain threatened, so they put up the top of the coupé. They were engaged in this task, Vaughan being inside the car, screwing down the fastenings of the hood, when a slight figure in a black cassock turned into the yard. Dykes, who was closing the stable door, was the first to see the priest, and, hearing his greeting, Tony and the doctor turned.
   “Good morning, Sir Anthony,” said the rector, “not a very promising day for a run.”
   “Good morning, Mr. Bennett,” returned Tony. “We’re going up to Town on business; more convenient by road. You have met Dr. Gaunt, I think?”
   They saluted each other, and at that moment Vaughan emerged from the car. At the sight of his gross figure the rector stiffened, and his face went deadly pale. Vaughan straightened himself, and their eyes met. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence, broken by Tony saying:
   “Er — Mr. Bennett, this is Mr. Vaughan.”
   Neither made the least offer to shake hands, though Vaughan bowed slightly. The rector remained motionless, his eyes fixed on the other’s face with terrible intensity. At last he spoke, in a voice so unlike his own that Tony was almost shocked.
   “I think we have met before,Mr. Vaughan,” he said slowly.
   “I don’t think so, Mr. Bennett,” replied the other with a nervous laugh.
   “No, I don’t suppose you would remember me,” answered the priest. “It is a long time ago, and I have changed a good deal, but I remember you very well.”
   “You have the advantage of me, then. Good day to you, sir.”
   And with this Vaughan went round the car and climbed into the back seat. Tony and Gaunt, who had stood motionless and decidedly uncomfortable during this short conversation, followed, Gaunt taking the wheel. A second later the engine roared into life, and further talk was impossible. The doctor let in his clutch, Tony waved a cheery farewell to the rector, and they swung out of the yard in a great flurry of dust.
   Not until the throb of the exhaust had died away up the narrow street did the rector move, and when he tried to walk he staggered. In a moment Dykes, who was still in the yard, ran to him and caught his arm.
   “Aren’t you well, Father?” he asked anxiously.
   “A little faint — it’s nothing really,” the old priest murmured; but the worthy landlord would not be denied.
   “Come inside and rest,” he urged. “Perhaps a spot of brandy wouldn’t be amiss, eh?”
   The rector allowed himself to be led away, his face drawn with pain, and a dreadful bewilderment in his eyes.* * *
   Gaunt drove without a break to Salisbury, which they reached at four o’clock in the afternoon. After a short stop there for a meal Vaughan took over the wheel, and by eight o’clock they had reached Ealing and turned on to the North Circular Road for Hampstead. Inside an hour the great car swung into the open gates of the house on the Heath.
   The same manservant who had admitted Hamilton, months before, had the door open, and was helping them out the moment the car stopped. After removing the stains of travel they sat down to a light dinner; after which they went to bed almost immediately, for both Gaunt and his colleague were very tired after their long drive, and the doctor insisted that Tony, though not so fatigued, must conserve his energies for the next day.
   Smoking a last cigarette before turning out the light, Tony reflected how cramped his room seemed, in spite of its superficial size, after the great stone-walled chambers of the Abbey. The papered walls, the white ceiling, the electric lamps with their silk shades, all appeared flimsy, ephemeral, beside the solid strength which he had grown accustomed to during the past months. Never again would he be quite happy away from Kestrel; he understood now why his father had never come back; the air of London was close and flavourless after that salty tang.
   He stubbed out his cigarette and clicked off the pendant switch. Why, there was no darkness, even, here! The rays of a distant street lamp found their way in through the wide sash-windows, flinging strange patterns on the walls. Save for the occasional sound of a passing car a profound silence enwrapped the house; the perpetual lullaby of the waves was absent. It was a long time before he fell asleep.
   All Tony had for breakfast was a little fruit and a tumblerful of cold water. This was by Gaunt’s instructions, and would be his last meal for twenty-four hours. It was essential that his spiritual faculties should be at their keenest, and this was one means to that end. He was to spend the daylight hours in solitary meditation, and the doctor took him up to a small room, scarcely more than an attic, under the roof. It was furnished in Spartan simplicity with a table and one chair. There was no window, only a skylight of opaque glass. Here Tony was left, with no company save his thoughts, but so adept was he now at the arts of concentration and meditation that the hours slipped quickly by and he lost all count of time.
   He sat rigid on his chair, like a marble figure, so still were his limbs. His hands were flat upon his knees, his breathing was rhythmical, his eyes closed. So withdrawn were his faculties that he was almost in a state of trance, and it may be that during those long hours thoughts which did not arise in his own brain were projected into his consciousness by the powerful will of his tutor.
   The oblong of light in the sloping roof faded as night fell, but Tony never moved. The shadows grew deeper, until at last his motionless figure became indistinguishable in the darkness, but still he sat on, awaiting the summons which would lead him to the supreme moment. His whole being was poised, expectant; all his previous excitement had passed away, and he was utterly calm.
   Somewhere a clock struck, and as he counted the distant strokes, the first contact he had made with the outer world for many hours, he realized that it was midnight. The hour was at hand.
   The door opened suddenly, letting in a dazzling flood of light which momentarily blinded him, and when he could see again Dr. Gaunt was standing before him, a lamp in one hand and a bundle of clothing in the other.
   Tony sprang to his feet, catching at the table to prevent himself falling as his numbed limbs refused their office.
   “Is it time?” he whispered hoarsely.
   The doctor nodded gravely, and set the lamp on the table. He was wearing a long robe of scarlet, like a monk’s habit, with the hood thrown back, leaving his head bare.
   “Take off your clothes,” he said quietly, and went out.
   When he returned, carrying a jug of water and a towel, Tony stood naked by the table, subduing by a tremendous effort the rising excitement which threatened to overwhelm him once more.
   “Repeat the ablutionary formula,” Gaunt commanded; and as Tony said the words he had been taught the other lifted the jug over his head and emptied its contents upon him. The water was icy cold, and the shock made every nerve in his body tingle, but as he toweled himself he thought that he had never felt so keen and fresh.
   Then the doctor proceeded to anoint him from head to foot with some pungent oil, applying it according to a set ritual— first to his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, then to his hands and feet, and then to the genitals. Finally he went over the whole surface of his pupil’s body, rubbing until the oil had been absorbed. From each point of contact Tony felt a violent shock, until at last his whole body was racked with a fiery pain, but as the doctor uttered the words of the ritual, and he forced himself to make the responses, the torment lessened and passed away, leaving a strange ethereal sensation, as if he were no longer subject to the laws of gravity.
   When Tony had put on the robe of plain white linen he followed Gaunt down the stairs, still feeling oddly weightless, and scarcely conscious of the treads beneath his bare feet. They stopped at a door on the first-floor landing, and the doctor knocked twice. The door opened a few inches; he exchanged a word with someone within and they were admitted.
   The room which they entered was of great size, and had probably been made by removing the dividing walls of several smaller rooms. The walls were completely covered with black curtains, hiding the windows, and any other doors there may have been. The floor was overlaid by an immense black carpet, whose thick pile muffled every footfall; even the ceiling was painted black, relieved only by a great pentagram in silver.
   The effect of this gloomy drapery was sombre in the extreme, and the absolute deadening of all echo made the voice sound thin and flat, as though one were on a mountain top.
   The sole source of illumination was at the extreme end of the chamber, where six tall candles of dark-coloured wax burned upon a bare stone altar, raised upon three low steps, with two massive seven-branched candlesticks of bronze on either side. On the right of the altar stood a great throne-like chair, heavily gilt, and Gaunt walked towards this, motioning Tony to follow him. As he went the young man caught a fleeting glimpse of some twenty figures, robed in black, their faces hidden by their hoods, seated on low benches at the other end of the room. When he reached the altar he knelt on the bottom step, while Gaunt took his place upon the throne.
   The deep notes of a hidden organ throbbed upon the still air, and the hooded figures on their benches took up the solemn chant. The words were in some strange tongue, and conveyed nothing to him, but the music stirred in Tony’s drowning consciousness, and he became aware of a tremendous atmosphere of purpose, as if the wills of all within the shrouded walls of the dark chamber were directed at him, urging him on, sustaining him in the great act of self-dedication which he was about to make. His own will awoke again, and joined with the rushing stream of volition about him, as he rose from his knees and waited.
   The music ceased, save for one lonely voice, which, rising and falling in a plaintive minor key, seemed to hold all the sorrows of the labouring world, crying out in its travail for deliverance from the perpetual bondage of space and time. So universal was the poignant appeal that Tony felt his throat constrict and the hot tears prick his eyes, while his own deep longing increased to an almost unbearable degree. The singing died away at last, and a pregnant silence filled the room.
   From behind him a large form, which Tony instantly recognized as Vaughan’s, despite the hood, approached and stood at his side, addressing the scarlet figure on the throne:
   “Most reverend Master, I present unto thee Anthony Lovell, who desires most earnestly to be admitted to the high fellowship of our Order.”
   Gaunt spoke, addressing Tony:
   “Dost thou desire to be admitted to the brotherhood of the ancient mysteries?”
   “I do so desire,” replied Tony in the accustomed form.
   “Approach, then, Anthony, the altar of our worship, and, kneeling at it, make the vows, as I shall bid thee.”
   Tony climbed the steps and knelt, resting his hands on the cool stone. Gaunt went on:
   “Swear, then, in the presence of those who will soon be thy brethren, to take upon thee the perpetual service of our Lord, to work His will in all things, to strive ever for the establishment of His Kingdom upon earth, and to obey they superiors at all times.”
   Obediently, almost in a dream, Tony repeated the oath. As he did so the thought flashed through his mind that this was the first time he had ever heard Gaunt mention any form of worship, particularly the worship of a Person, but before his dulled brain could grasp the significance of this the Master’s voice continued:
   “Swear, then, that never wilt thou reveal the inner secrets of the Order, and of thy service therein, to any living soul outside that Order.”
   “I swear!”
   “Repeat after me: All these things do I swear by the Seal of Solomon, by the Veil of Isis, by the Key of Ashtaroth, and by the Name of Names; and if I break this oath may my soul be cast into the Abyss.”
   Automatically Tony said the words after him. The queer sensation of floating which had been with him ever since the anointing was growing more and more powerful; his head was spinning, and he was scarcely conscious of his surroundings. His one desire was to get this business over and lie down; he had almost forgotten the burning thirst for knowledge which had possessed him only a few minutes before.
   “Anthony, stand up and face thy brethren,” said the remorseless voice.
   Long obedience to his tutor brought Tony staggering to his feet; he turned, clinging to the altar behind him with both hands. There in the gloom was the double row of dark figures, their eyes glowing in the recesses of their hoods, all staring fixedly at him; the concentrated stream of energy pouring from them beat upon him like a steady wind.
   “Now swear the most mighty oath of all, and receive freely all we have to give of knowledge, power, and secret wisdom. Repeat after me: All this do I swear in the Name *****.”
   Here Gaunt uttered a word which may not be written, and as the awful syllables throbbed upon the still air it seemed to Tony that an icy wind blew about his thinly clad body and the floor rocked beneath his feet. Twice he opened his mouth, twice he strove to force his lips to frame the words, while within his drugged brain a thin small voice screamed shrilly,“No! No! No!”
   Then, lifted on the stream of volition from those sinister watching figures, his own will strengthened, caught hold, and in a firm voice he swore the oath.
   As the awful words died echoless against the shrouded walls a frightful silence fell, and it seemed to Tony that he stood there motionless for an eternity, while all around him the dust of ages drifted down ceaselessly, like gentle snow. Then the sable hangings, the scarlet figure on the throne, the paunchy form beside it, and those others in the background all faded from his sight, leaving only a fathomless gulf in which he floated, bodiless. All around was the void of outer space, sown with blazing stars, and before his eyes the great globe of the earth spun slowly on its axis, presenting shimmering seas and shadowy continents to his strangely incurious gaze as it rotated.
   All at once he knew that he was not alone in the void, for behind him he could feel a Presence hovering, like a dark cloud veiling the stars, and casting its shadow upon the very earth beneath, and a Voice whispered softly to his soul:“All this will I give unto thee…”
   For an instant one tiny point of light flickered in a corner of his being, then, as his conscience died, that too was overwhelmed by the great flood of darkness pouring in, and without another effort he gave up the pitifully unequal struggle. Staggering down the steps, he turned and fell upon his face, worshiping the awful Presence that hovered upon the altar.
   Gaunt sank back in his chair, his face a mask of devilish triumph, and Vaughan leapt forward, standing over Tony’s prostrate figure. Raising his hands aloft, the hood falling back from his face, he cried:
   “O Satan, Lord, receive this Thy servant whom we here dedicate to Thee. Be with him in life, and in death, and through all eternity, and uphold him with Thine almighty power!”
   At a sign from Gaunt two of the hooded brethren advanced, lifted Tony’s slight form, and laid him on the altar. Then began the monstrous blasphemy of the Black Mass.
   But Tony was hardly conscious of it, for the reek of the incense curling about him in thick yellow clouds still further stupefied his senses, and finished the work which the ointment had begun. His mind, however, was quite clear and active, and he realized perfectly what was being done: how he was being finally consecrated to the service of the Prince of Darkness.
   That all this was quite unnecessary he knew full well. With that one act of worship he had sealed his doom for ever, but he was not afraid, and had no regrets. He realized that he must have known, subconsciously, all through the long months of his preparation, where it was all leading to. Only the consummate skill of Nicholas Gaunt had prevented him from realizing it in time to draw back, and he doubted, even now, if he would have drawn back, had he known all. For the dark power surging through his veins filled him with exultation; he knew at last that this was the only certain way to all knowledge and all mastery. The wisdom of the Serpent coiled about his brain, and he saw the current of desire in which all things move, and knew that he could direct it as he willed.
   He felt a tremendous scorn of all weak things, and all things pitiful: Jesus of Nazareth, and John Hamilton— they passed through his mind together, pale shadows both; he rejected them utterly. This was the way of the strong, into whose hands the lordship over all things was given. Darkness reigned supreme, and he was of the legions of the darkness, and was glad.
   Chapter XII
   I
   The sun was shining gloriously over the sea, and lighting up the moorland road from Portreath to Pentock, along which John Hamilton was striding, swinging his ash-plant. That morning he had come from Otterham by rail, and by the railway motor from Redruth to Portreath.
   The city pallor was gone from his face, for in spite of the heavy rain which had fallen during the greater part of his ten-days’ tramp he had been in the open practically the whole time, and the intervals of sunshine had given him a fair tan. His clothes had suffered a good deal, being badly creased and crumpled from many wettings, and his flannel trousers were liberally splashed with mud. A rent in his jacket testified to an encounter with a furze bush near Camelford, and owing to an early start that morning he had omitted to shave. Altogether he looked a distinctly unconventional figure, but he felt in splendid health and spirits, and whistled cheerfully as he walked.
   When he drew near to the narrow ravine in which the village lay he struck off the road along the path which led to the cliff top and down by the church, for he intended to call on the rector at once. He had conceived a great affection for the old man, and was looking forward to seeing him again with much pleasure.
   Soon he reached the cliffs and had a view of the open sea, with Kestrel in the distance. What had happened there in his absence, he wondered, and how was Tony? These questions would soon be answered. Reaching the steep descent, he shortened his stride.
   On reaching the rectory gate he had something of a shock, for, sitting on a deck-chair on the lawn in front of the house, was a girl, reading.
   He pushed open the gate and approached, rather diffidently, the gravel crunching beneath his heavy shoes. The girl raised her eyes from her book, and he had a swift vision of a sweet oval face surrounded by a mass of short dark curls. Before he could speak she said:
   “You wanted to see my uncle? I’m afraid he’s out just now. But come round to the back, and I’ll see if I can find something for you.”
   She rose lightly, dropping the book on her chair, and he saw that she was very slim, and that her legs were bare. It was evident that she took him for a tramp seeking the rector’s charity. Small wonder, too, he thought, looking ruefully down at his bedraggled appearance. Wondering what to do, he followed her round to the back door.
   Once in the kitchen, she said:
   “Sit down, please, and I’ll make you some tea. I think Mrs. Drew must be upstairs.”
   Obediently he sat down at the bare table, thinking furiously, striving to frame some sort of explanation which would not embarrass her.
   The kettle was singing on the hob, and in a few minutes he had made the tea and poured out a cup, which she set before him, together with a piece of meat pie which she found in the cupboard. Her proximity, as she leaned over the table, made him feel hotter and grimier than ever, for she was dressed all in white, and looked as fresh and cool as a flower.
   Thinking that perhaps after he had finished he could escape before the rector returned, Hamilton began to eat. Indeed the food was welcome, for he had walked several miles in the heat of the day since lunching at Portreath.
   The girl perched herself on the edge of the table, swinging her legs and looking out of the window. Hamilton felt extremely uncomfortable.
   When he had finished she asked if he had had enough, and, receiving a satisfactory answer, offered him a cigarette. Thinking longingly of the pipe reposing in his pocket, Hamilton dutifully accepted one, and, when the girl followed suit, found his matches and gave her a light. As he held the flame for her he saw her eyes fall on his hands, which, though very dirty at present, were well cared for, and she looked up at him curiously.
   Now or never, he told himself, and was just opening his lips to speak when the door opened and the rector came in.
   The old man stopped short, stared for a moment, then asked:
   “Why, Valerie my dear, what’s this?”
   “Oh, uncle, this gentleman came to see you, so I gave him some tea.”
   The rector looked hard at the blushing Hamilton and his lips twitched.
   “All right, my dear, thank you. Run along now.”
   With another quick glance at Hamilton the girl left them, going out through the back door. When she had gone the rector continued:
   “Well, Mr. Hamilton, you nearly took me in for a moment. I am glad to see you.”
   “And I you, Father!” They shook hands heartily. “I’m afraid I got in under false colours. Your niece didn’t give me a chance to explain. I feel an awful fool.”
   “Don’t worry about that, my boy. She’s a dear girl, and generous to a fault. She’d feed every vagabond in the duchy if she got a chance. Would you like a wash?”
   “Very much indeed, Father. But if you don’t mind, I’ll slip along to the inn and change as well.”
   “As you wish. But come back to dinner. I’ve a lot to talk over with you.”
   Hamilton left by the front door, but Valerie was not to be seen. He wondered very much what she would say when next they met.
   An hour later he was back again, and this time the housekeeper, Mrs. Drew, let him in.
   “The Father’s in church, saying his office, sir, but Miss Valerie’s in the study.”
   She led him to the little room overlooking the garden, where Valerie was sitting in one of the big leather-covered chairs in front of a cheerful fire.
   “Come in, Mr. Hamilton,” she cried when he was announced; “Uncle’s told me all about you.”
   “Thank you, Miss Bennett. I’m afraid I made an awful ass of myself this afternoon.”
   “Well, you might have explained yourself a little.” She blushed delightfully. “Do sit down; Uncle won’t be long.”
   As Hamilton sank into the opposite chair she went on:
   “I was very angry with you at first, but I suppose I did take things a little for granted.”
   “The fault was mine entirely; I should never have come as I was, but I expected to find the rector alone.”
   “Naturally. I’ve only been here two days. I always come for my holidays, you see.”
   “I envy you, Miss Bennett. This is only my second visit to Cornwall, and I’m just finding out all I’ve missed in not coming here more often.”
   “You enjoyed your tramp, then?” she asked.
   “Rather! It rained a lot, but I saw all the places I wanted to. But there are lots more left for my next visit.”
   “When will that be?”
   “I really couldn’t say. I have to take my holiday when I can. It’s not always easy to get away.”
   “You’re a writer, aren’t you?”
   “Yes. Journalism and short stories. Nothing much.”
   “But it’s creative work, and that makes all the difference, doesn’t it?” She sighed. “Mine’s not, and so my fortnight is rather precious. I’ve been in an office in Bristol ever since Daddy died, and it’s pretty deadly sometimes. I look forward to staying with Uncle here. There’s no one else, you see.”
   She spoke quite simply, without emotion, but Hamilton could feel the depth of loneliness behind the words. Finding no adequate reply, he remained silent, while she sat staring into the fire, her chin resting on her hands. He noticed that she was now wearing simple dark dress, and that her unruly curls were neatly arranged. If possible, she looked even more lovely than when he had first seen her. Her pale cheeks owed, perhaps, a little of their rose to art, but her delicate brows were natural, he could swear, and her mouth was a thing to set any poet’s heart a-beating. Proud it was, and firm, but with a deceptive firmness, for he knew full well that the chiseled outline of the warm red lips would vanish at a touch, and become as melting soft as the heart of any rose.
   He was awakened from this delicious reverie by the entrance of the rector.
   “Well, my children, have you explained yourselves now?” he asked. “Good! Let’s go and have dinner.”
   During the meal they talked about Hamilton’s walking tour, and upon a variety of general topics, but when Valerie had left them, the old priest unburdened himself.
   “My boy,” said he, “I am desperately afraid.”
   So earnest was his tone that Hamilton stopped filling his pipe and stared at him. He went on:
   “I saw your friend Tony and his two associates yesterday morning. They were just setting off for London by road. I was introduced to Mr. Simon Vaughan.”
   He stopped abruptly, and Hamilton leaned forward, his heart beating quickly.
   “Yes, Father,” he breathed. “Go on!”
   “It is he! There can be no mistake: that false priest I told you of when last we talked together. It is forty years since I saw him, but he has not changed — those drooping eyelids; that sensuous mouth — I would know them anywhere.”
   Hamilton uttered a sharp cry as the match he was holding burned his fingers. Wild thoughts scurried through his brain.
   “But, Father,” he stammered, “you said he was sixty then.”
   “I know. He was — and is still, by all appearances. John, what does it mean? In God’s name, whatdoes it mean? I tell you, I went straight back to the church and prayed for three hours before the Tabernacle. I have scarcely slept since. My boy— there’s devilry afoot!”
   When Hamilton replied he affected a lightness he was far from feeling.
   “You must be mistaken, Father — some chance likeness, perhaps. And even if it were the same he may have managed to arrest the natural approach of age somehow. That power was claimed by the adepts, was it not?”
   “Oh, yes, I know. I’m not much concerned with his apparent age. Were it anyone else I would agree with you, and attribute it to some miraculous control over nature. Methuselah lived to be nine hundred, we are told. But that’s not the point. What I mean is that I know the man to be wholly evil. I cannot tell you the details of the unspeakable foulness for which he was expelled from the Church, but you can take if from me that such a monster could never change his character. When you told me of your friend’s new faith, I set it down as comparatively harmless transcendental magic, such as was practiced by the Rosicrucians and others; but, believe me, this Vaughan would have no hand in such child’s play, as he would doubtless term it.”
   A dreadful suspicion of the other’s meaning began to form in Hamilton’s mind.
   “You mean —?” he whispered.
   “I mean Satanism — Black Magic — of the most damnable and abominable kind.”
   “No, Father, it’s impossible! Even if you are right about Vaughan, Tony would never go in for such a thing.”
   “He may not know what he is doing until it is too late. The Serpent is a devilishly subtle beast.”
   “We must save him.” Hamilton sprang to his feet.
   “How? What can we do?”
   “Follow them — go to London — to Gaunt’s home.”
   “And then what? Break down the door? Call the police, and tell them that devil-worship is going on? No, John, you would be laughed at. Authority does not recognize these things any more.”
   Hamilton sank down again.
   “But still they go on,” he muttered, covering his face with his hands.
   “Yes, they still go on. In London, Paris, New York — every great city of the world — these abominable cults still persist. We can do nothing for your friend, my son. Only God can save him now. We can but pray to Him. I said a Mass of the Holy Ghost this morning for Anthony Lovell’s soul. There is little else to be done. Even now he is probably initiated.”
   Hamilton groaned aloud, twisting his fingers in his hair.
   “Can we do nothing, then,” he cried — “not one single mortal thing?”
   “I have one other suggestion, my boy.”
   “What’s that?”
   “Go across to the Abbey, while they are away, and try to find out what is going on there. I feel certain that the focus of the whole foul business lies on Kestrel.”
   Hamilton uncovered his face, fresh hope dawning in his eyes.
   “I’ll go tomorrow,” he said eagerly; “where can I get a boat?”
   “I’ll speak to one of my choirmen. He’ll take you across. Shall I come with you?”
   “No, Father, I’ll go alone, if you don’t mind. I feel, somehow, that it is my responsibility.”
   “Very well. I shall pray most earnestly for you. Come to Mass tomorrow.”
   “I will. May I make my confession tonight?”
   “Of course. We will go into church when you leave here. Now shall we join Valerie? Not a word to her, naturally.”
   Composing their features, and resolutely thrusting aside the black thoughts which crowded their minds, they returned to the study.
   II
   For the third time in five minutes Hamilton ducked to avoid the swinging boom as the little boat changed its course. There was a slight rain falling in the stiff wind, and he sat huddled in his mackintosh, feeling rather miserable. The man at the tiller, his pipe inverted to keep out the wet, hardly spoke at all, but concentrated on the difficult job of tacking against the wind.
   Half-way across they sighted the Abbey launch, with Tom Tregellis at the wheel, and the two boatmen exchanged a hail. The mist of rain made observation difficult, but Hamilton fancied he could make out another figure crouched in the bottom of the launch. He was still wondering who it could be when they ran into smooth water in the lee of the island, and the brown sail hung limp. The fisherman got out his oars and began to row strongly for the harbour mouth.
   It was dank and cold within the sheltering rocks, and Hamilton’s spirits sank even lower as he stood up and prepared to jump for the landing-stage.
   When he had accomplished this feat in safety, he gave his instructions to the man who had brought him across:
   “Wait for me. If I’m not back in an hour, go back and tell Father Bennett.”
   The man nodded silently, and began to refill his pipe. Hamilton started on the long climb up to the Abbey.
   The wicket in the outer door was latched, but yielded to pressure, and he stepped through into the courtyard. Here it was very gloomy, and the narrow window-slits of the building frowned at him like so many suspicious eyes. An indefinable chill settled upon his heart, but he took his courage in both hands and crossed resolutely to the inner door. Mounting the steps leading up to it, he pulled the bell. After a little interval there was a sound of bolts being withdrawn, the door opened a crack, and Lorrimer’s frightened face peered out at him. Recognizing the visitor, he brightened remarkably, and, opening the door wide, besought him to enter.
   Once inside, and the door secured again, he spoke to Hamilton in a husky, fearful voice.
   “I’m very glad to see you, sir, and that’s the truth. I didn’t hardly know what to do. Come through into the kitchen, sir, if you don’t mind. The missus’ll be that pleased.”
   Mrs. Lorrimer welcomed Hamilton with no less warmth, taking off his wet coat and giving him a chair beside the fire. When his pipe was going satisfactorily he asked Lorrimer to tell him exactly what was the matter.
   “It’s Mr. Tony, sir — I mean Sir Anthony, and those other two,” the old servant burst out; “I don’t know what they’re up to, but I don’t like it. That Mr. Vaughan stays down in the crypt all day; and Sir Anthony and Dr. Gaunt, cooped up in the library with all them books — it’s not natural, sir. I’ve had a look at some of their books, too, sir, after they’ve gone to bed — I know I shouldn’t have, but I felt I must. And they’re not good books. It’s my belief, sir, that they’re leading Sir Anthony astray somehow.”
   “Is that all you have to tell me, Lorrimer?” asked Hamilton, as the other paused for breath.
   “No, sir, not by half. There’s other things besides — things that Mr. Tony don’t know about. I’m generally up pretty early in the morning, sir, and time and again I’ve seen the doctor and his friend come up out of the crypt, long before Sir Anthony was awake. They came close by me once,and their clothes smelt of that stuff they burn in Popish churches — incense they call it. What have they been up to so early? — that’s what I asks myself, sir. No good, I’ll be bound. And now they’ve gone off, taking the master with them, and leaving us alone. We don’t like it, sir.”
   “You’ve been left here before, surely?”
   “No, sir, not for longer than a day since old Sir Anthony first brought us from London with him. Besides, it’s different now. Can’t you feel it, sir? The place feels different.”
   Hamilton leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, trying to get in touch with the atmosphere of the Abbey, but he could only feel the warmth of the fire, and smell his own tobacco-smoke. Lorrimer watched him, saying:
   “No, sir, you won’t feel anything here. It’s kind of home-like with the missus and me living here, but in the hall it’s terrible sometimes. A sort of nasty feeling, like as if you was in a heathen temple. You’ve noticed it too, haven’t you, my dear?” He addressed the last question to his wife.
   “Yes, Mr. Hamilton, sir, it’s quite right what he says,” she replied; “we daren’t go out of here after dark, not into the hall we daren’t. We hadn’t used to be afraid, not when the old master was alive, in spite of the tales they told, but it’s changed now. Like as if something had woken up.”
   “Hush, my dear,” her husband broke in, “you mustn’t say things like that. There’s a God above who’ll take care of us — we needn’t be afraid. But Sir Anthony don’t think as we do, sir — he’s not a religious man, and some harm might come to him.”
   While he had been speaking a thought had been stirring in Hamilton’s brain. Now it crystallized, and he voiced it:
   “Where is Johnston, Sir Anthony’s man, Lorrimer? What’s he think of all this?”
   “I was coming to that, sir: he’s gone; went this morning.”
   “So that was whom I saw in the launch. Why did he go?”
   “Said he couldn’t stick it no longer, sir. Said he’d been in some queer places in his time, but none so queer as this. He’d been whittling for quite a while now, but last night finished him.”
   “What happened last night?” Hamilton inquired.
   Lorrimer looked uneasily at his wife.
   “We heard it again, sir,” said he, “like on the night Sir Anthony died.”
   “Heard what?”
   “I don’t know what it was, sir, and I hope to God I shan’t ever know. It’d be about one o’clock this morning, wouldn’t it, my dear?”
   His wife assented, and he went on:
   “It woke us up, sir: a sort of shaking of the whole building, like an earthquake; and then such a hullabaloo as you never heard, sir. A kind of shouting and a bellowing, as if all hell was let loose under us. We heard it before, the night the old master died, but not near so bad as this.”
   “What did you do?” Hamilton was intensely interested.
   “What could we do, sir? Nothing; just lay still and prayed for sunrise. The noise stopped after a bit, but the trembling went on for hours. It finished Johnston, as I told you, sir. Wouldn’t listen to reason. Just up and went as soon as Tom was ready to take him.”
   “Amazing, Lorrimer! You’re quite sure it wasn’t the sea, or the wind, or something like that?”
   “Oh, no, sir” — the servant shook his head decidedly — “the sea was a bit rough and the wind was blowing, but you couldn’t call it a storm even. Besides, the noise seemed to come from beneath, in the rock itself.”
   “I see,” Hamilton nodded, then looked sharply at the other. “Have you ever been down into the crypt?”
   “No, sir, not I! I wouldn’t meddle with such things.”
   “Are you game to come down with me now? I came over this morning to find out what was going on, and I believe that is the place to start.”
   Lorrimer was silent for several seconds, and Hamilton could see the sweat glisten in tiny droplets upon his forehead. Then he stood up, saying quietly:
   “I’ll come with you, sir. We’ll take a lamp from the hall.”
   “Good man!” Hamilton jumped to his feet, clapping him on the shoulder. Mrs. Lorrimer said nothing.
   “Are you coming, too, Mrs. Lorrimer?” Hamilton asked.
   She shook her head.
   “No, sir. I’ll stay here and pray for you both.”
   Hamilton knocked out his pipe and thrust it in his pocket; a thought occurred to him.
   “Have you any sort of weapon?” he asked. “We may as well be prepared for anything.”
   Lorrimer looked wonderingly at him.
   “I don’t think weapons’d be much use against the powers of darkness, sir,” he said.
   Hamilton smiled grimly.
   “Probably not, but the powers of darkness sometimes have mortal agents. Anything will do — an old shot-gun, for instance.”
   The other scratched his head.
   “I can do better than that, sir,” he said at last; “there should be a pistol in the library. Old Sir Anthony used to keep it there. Souvenir of the war, I think it was.”
   “Fine. Let’s go.”
   They went out of the kitchen, along the passage, and into the library. Going to the desk by the window, Lorrimer began to rummage in its drawers. Hamilton stood by the long table, idly turning over the books which still littered it. As far as he could see they were harmless enough, though they all dealt with the occult. There was no suggestion of Satanism, certainly. He was knitting his brows over Levi’sRituel de la Haute Magie when he heard an exclamation of satisfaction, and, looking up, saw Lorrimer with a heavy automatic pistol in his hands.
   Hamilton took the weapon gingerly and examined it. It was a pre-war Luger, and he was unfamiliar with the mechanism, but a little fumbling released a cartridge-clip from the butt, and he saw the blunt noses of seven bullets lying meekly side by side. The thing was fully loaded. Laying the clip on the table, he attempted to pull the jacket back. It was immovable, so he pressed the trigger gently, pointing the muzzle at the floor. It was as well he did, for a heavy report shook the room, the pistol almost leaped from his grasp, and he found himself looking ruefully at a neat black hole in the carpet, while the acrid smoke rose in wreaths about his head.
   Lorrimer came to his side and took the gun from him.
   “I think I know how to work it, sir,” he said, and jerked the jacket back. The empty shell spun through the air and tinkled in the hearth.
   “Sir Anthony showed me once. I didn’t know it was loaded though; there must have been a cartridge in the breech.”
   He demonstrated the mechanism to Hamilton, replaced the clip and, clicking down the safety-catch, handed the weapon back to him.
   “It’s ready now, sir. But be careful. It’ll shoot off the whole magazine before you know where you are.”
   He bent down and retrieved the cartridge-case from the hearth and then opened the window.
   “Best not leave any traces for them to see, sir,” he explained. “I don’t think Sir Anthony knows the gun was there. You’d better keep it, sir.”
   They went out into the corridor, to find Mrs. Lorrimer standing at the open door of the kitchen, one hand on her breast. Her startled face framed a wordless question.
   “It’s all right, Mrs. Lorrimer,” Hamilton assured her. “Just a little target-practice. No damage done.”
   She nodded and withdrew, closing the door.
   As they entered the hall Hamilton threw back his head and sniffed sharply. But he could detect no smell, though there had been a distinct change in the atmosphere. Putting it aside as indefinable, he helped Lorrimer to light one of the vapour-lamps which hung on brackets round the walls, holding a match ready while the other worked the little pump to give the initial pressure. In a few minutes the lamp was hissing cheerfully and giving a good light. Lorrimer took up the lamp and they went to the stone trap beneath the great staircase, and Hamilton lifted it.
   Gingerly they crept down the spiral stair, Hamilton going first. As they descended he began to be more and more aware of an intense oppression, which seemed to weigh upon him like an invisible cloud. Strange and horrible thoughts, quite foreign to his nature, began to crawl about his mind, and by the time they reached the bottom step he was in the grip of a dreadful wave of despair, which well-nigh overwhelmed him. This visit, his efforts to save Tony from himself, all seemed utterly useless, ridiculous in their pitiful futility. How typical of Life itself, he thought, this miserable struggle against hideous Destiny! His knees shook, and he would have fallen, quite overcome by the dark clouds of evil which swirled about that silent place, had not Lorrimer gripped his arm and held the lamp close to his face.
   “I know how you feel, sir,” whispered the old man. “I can feel it too. It’s the same upstairs sometimes, only not so bad. Try and shake it off, sir. Remember, God’s with us everywhere.”
   Feverishly Hamilton caught at that last assurance, striving to fix his mind upon the service he had attended that morning, and That which he had received there. Immediately he felt stronger, and was able to make the sign of the cross with a trembling hand.
   “The Cross of Christ between me and all harm!” he whispered, and felt strength flow back into his limbs.
   Clinging to each other, the two crept down the middle of the crypt, between the rows of pillars supporting the vaulted roof. They had almost reached the centre when Lorrimer, who was a little in front, stopped with a sharp cry. Hamilton, his heart thudding in his throat, asked what was the matter.
   “I can’t go any further, sir. There — there seems to be something in the way.”
   Feeling that his brain was going, Hamilton took a step forward, only to find himself brought up sharply against an invisible barrier. For a moment stark panic rose screaming in his soul, and he all but fled incontinently. When he had got hold of himself again he took the lamp from the other’s shaking fingers, which threatened to drop it at any moment, and held it aloft.
   There was nothing to be seen, only the avenue of pillars disappearing into the darkness beyond the rays of the lamp. There was no tangible obstruction, but, strive as he would, he could not advance one foot farther forward. It was as if a transparent sheet of rubber was stretched tightly across their path. Sweating with a curious combination of fear and baffled rage, he lowered the lamp and scanned the ground. Then he saw the diagram. Its outermost circle, a brilliant, luminous red against the dark stone flags, marked the limit of their progress. The complexity of lines within stretched away from them in the gloom.
   Intense curiosity partly overcoming their dread, the two made a complete circuit of the outside edge of the figure, but at no point could they penetrate into its interior; the invisible force restrained them always. Dimly they could make out the dark mass of the altar, with its white tapes, but their light was not strong enough to see it clearly. At one point they came upon Vaughan’s two trunks, standing outside the circle, but both were locked, and to have forced them would have meant leaving visible traces of their visit, and this they were loath to do. At length they were obliged to confess that there was nothing more to be done, so they retraced their steps to the floor above.
   When the trap was shut and the lamp replaced Lorrimer asked Hamilton what he made of it. The latter shrugged, his face a picture of bewilderment.
   “I don’t know what to make of it,” said he. “I have never believed that such things were possible. Now I see that they are. If that is Dr. Gaunt’s doing, or his colleague’s, and I suppose it must be, then it only goes to prove that they do possess an amazing power. I suppose they didn’t want anyone to go near the altar, for that’s what I presume it was, and accordingly took steps to prevent it. At all events, we don’t seem to be any nearer a solution of the mystery than we were before. I’m completely at a loss.”
   Lorrimer nodded; he was far less disturbed than Hamilton.
   “Well, sir,” he said, “I never thought I should live to see a miracle, but now I have. I wish I could believe that it was one such as Moses did, but I’m afraid that it is more like those of Pharaoh’s wizards. We’re swimming in deep waters, sir.”
   They reached the kitchen door and went in. Mrs. Lorrimer was standing by the fire, her whole body tense. As soon as she saw them she relaxed, and going to her husband, quietly kissed him.
   “Thank God you’re both safe!” said she. Her husband looked down at her gravely.
   “Amen to that, my dear,” he said. “We’ve been in a strange place, and seen queer things, Mr. Hamilton and I. But I’ll tell you about it later. Now, sir, I don’t want to rush you, or to seem inhospitable, but I’m expecting them back any time, and I think you’d better be going.”
   “Yes, it wouldn’t do for them to find me here.” Hamilton took up his coat, and Lorrimer helped him into it.
   “I shall be staying at the Three Fishermen for a while,” he continued, “and if you’re willing to stay on here you can keep me informed through Tom Tregellis. Let me know at once if anything definite happens.”
   “That I will, thank you, sir. Of course we’ll stay; we’ll do our duty by Sir Anthony while we’re able to.”
   “Very well, then. Good-bye, and God keep you both.” Hamilton shook hands with them, and Lorrimer escorted him out through a back door and round to the outer gate. He went down to the harbour alone, to find his boatman turning the boat round preparatory to departing. Seeing Hamilton, the man rowed back to the landing-stage.
   “I was just off, sir,” he explained; “you’ve been gone well over the hour.”
   “Sorry! I suppose I have. I’m glad you waited, though,” Hamilton said, climbing aboard.
   As they were rowing out of the little harbour the man looked curiously at his passenger.
   “Queer place, that, sir?” he remarked, interrogatively.
   Hamilton nodded.
   “Very queer.” He did not feel disposed to be drawn into a conversation which he knew would be broadcast over the village, and contented himself with non-committal replies to the leading questions which were fired at him from time to time.
   He was forced into revealing action, however, when, only half a mile from Pentock, he saw the white shape of the Abbey launch coming towards them. Silently cursing the unfortunate coincidence, he flung himself into the bottom of the boat and pulled a tarpaulin over his body. His pilot stared at him in astonishment as he asked in a low voice:
   “That launch; how many are there aboard?”
   The other peered under his hand.
   “There be three, sir, besides Tom Tregellis; Sir Anthony, it looks like, and two others. They’ll be his two friends, like as not. Don’t you want them to see you, sir?”
   “No,” said Hamilton shortly, and pulled the tarpaulin over his face. It was hot, and smelt abominably, but he stayed under it until the launch had passed only a cable’s-length away, and their own boat had entered the harbour and was hidden by the wall.* * *
   After lunching at the inn Hamilton made his way to the rectory. Valerie met him at the door, greeting him gaily with:
   “Good afternoon, Mr. Hamilton. Are you hungry this time?”
   He tried desperately to echo her carefree tone, but was conscious that he failed dismally as he answered:
   “No, thanks, Miss Bennett. I’ve just had lunch. Is the rector in?”
   “I think so. Do come in! Will you stay for tea?”
   “Thanks. I’d love to.” Hamilton was peering anxiously over her shoulder towards the study. Ever since his strange experience of the morning his one thought had been to tell the old priest of this amazing confirmation of their worst fears. He scarcely noticed the girl, and she, sensing his lack of interest, gave up the attempt to entertain him and took him straight to the rector.
   “Uncle, here’s Mr. Hamilton,” she said; “he’s got something on his mind and won’t rest until he’s seen you. From his face I think he must have murdered someone.”
   Her uncle put down his book. For perhaps one second a tiny frown appeared between his brows and a reproof trembled on his lips. Then he remembered that she knew nothing of the grim secret which lay between Hamilton and himself, and he smiled gravely.
   “Thank you, my dear,” he said. “Come in and sit down, my boy. Have some tobacco — I’ve got a new tin today.”
   Hamilton sat down and began to fill his pipe in silence. The girl hovered uncertainly at the door, looking curiously from one to the other.
   “I’ll leave you to it, then,” said she. “Don’t be too hard on him, Uncle.”
   When the door had closed behind her the rector spoke:
   “Not a word until your pipe’s going, John. And take your time; I can see it was pretty bad.”
   Collecting his thoughts, the young man told him the whole story of his visit to Kestrel, and what he had found in the crypt. Not until it was finished did the other speak, but smoked his pipe quietly, betraying no sign of astonishment at the bizarre tale. When he spoke he said:
   “If your visit has accomplished nothing else, my boy, it has convinced you that these people do possess a real and terrifying power. That is very important, for we must not underestimate our opponents. I must confess that I have never actually experienced anything so objective as this barrier youspeak of, but I have never doubted for one moment that such things are possible. I rather think you did at one time.”
   “Yes, Father,” Hamilton agreed. “But never again. That has settled all my doubts, once and for all. But now the question is, what is it all about, and what are we to do?”
   “We cannot do anything yet except wait for further developments. You have established communication with the Lorrimers, at all events.”
   “Yes, I suppose that is something,” assented Hamilton. “The simple faith of those two old people is amazing, Father. I couldn’t have stood half what they’ve gone through.”
   “You may have to stand more before this episode is over, John. I wish I knew what they have in mind. All this seems a tremendous lot of trouble to go to to gain one convert to their beastly faith. We must not lose sight of the other possible purpose of that magic circle.”
   “Why, Father, what do you mean?” Hamilton was startled. “It could only be intended to keep intruders out, surely.”
   “It might also serveto keep something in,” the priest answered quietly.
   Hamilton could feel the colour draining from his cheeks as he said:
   “The bellowing sound?”
   The other nodded.
   “That may have been the wind, of course. I place more reliance on your own sensations when descending into the crypt. You might have imagined the feeling of evil, being prepared for it, but the assault of despair is very significant. It seems to point to the presence of some intelligent entity, which was endeavouring to persuade you of the hopelessness of attempting to interfere.”
   “What a horrible idea, Father!”
   “We may encounter things more horrible before we’ve done, my boy. I take it you are determined to see this through?”
   “Absolutely,” Hamilton answered firmly. “I shall stay here until there is no more hope for Tony.”
   “Say, rather, until Tony is saved.”
   “There is a hope, then?” Hamilton’s voice was eager.
   “There is always hope. If we could once get him out of the influence of those two wretches we might work wonders. I have been polishing up my knowledge of these matters today.” The rector picked up the book he had been reading and gave it to Hamilton, who glanced at the title,The Brethren of the Left-Hand Path.
   “It is not very edifying reading for a priest,” he went on, “but it is necessary that we should know what to expect. They are diabolically clever, these people, and I can well understand your friend getting caught up by their specious reasoning, especially if he has had no instruction in Catholic tradition and the teaching of the Church.”
   “I expect he was brought up as a Christian, Father.”
   “No doubt, but in that milk-and-water Christianity which is so common these days. Our faith is a glorious adventure, a flaming reality, or it is nothing. I doubt if it was ever real to him, and consequently he did not realize that this Satanism is merely a perversion of the Catholic religion. They have their Masses, and their dark sacraments, you know. Their ritual is elaborate and full of meaning, as ours is: quite attractive to the superficial observer; while their claim to greater knowledge and objective power is undeniable. They can, and do, effect far greater material results than we do, but at what a cost!” He fell silent, and Hamilton asked:
   “Why should they fear the cost, if it is simply damnation, and the final union with their Master?”
   “So their false reasoning runs. But they are wrong; they may achieve that union for a while — even after death, but I cannot believe they reach eternity that way. We are taught that at the Last Day Satan himself shall perish, and with him all these unhappy souls who have thrown in their lot with him. Of course they deny this, claiming that Darkness has always existed, as a co-equal of Light, and that Darkness will conquer in the end. But I will not believe that: it is inconceivable in the light of our faith. God is omnipotent, and the Devil merely a rebellious angel, fallen from grace.”
   “Poor old Tony,” Hamilton mused, “to get taken in by all this clap-trap. I hope to God we can do something about it.”
   “Amen,” answered the priest. “If we could only get him away somehow! I do not think they are really very much concerned with him; we shouldn’t meet much opposition from them, only from the boy himself, poor fool! I can’t believe that he is such a tremendous acquisition to them.”
   “He’s pretty well off, you know,” Hamilton reminded him; “they may be after his money.”
   The other shook his head.
   “I don’t think so,” said he. “They are not short of means, and I shouldn’t imagine wealth by itself would hold much attraction for them. It may be Kestrel, though, that they are after. Such an unholy spot, so admirably situated, would make a very desirable stronghold for the headquarters of their Order. I wonder…” His voice died away, and for a while they sat silent, smoking their pipes. At last the rector spoke again.
   “Well, John,” he said, “I think we have chewed over this business long enough for today. Let’s go and have some tea. And listen, you mustn’t get obsessed with these things. Don’t let them get hold of you; keep your mind clear; I’ll do the worrying. We can do no more at present, so tryand forget all about it. Dr. Pellew is coming up this evening for a game of chess with me, and I suggest that you take Valerie for a walk, and try and put Kestrel out of your head for a while.”
   “There’s nothing I should like better, Father.”
   “Splendid! Now we’ll say no more about Tony Lovell and his troubles today. Agreed?”
   “Agreed, Father.”
   After tea Hamilton and Valerie set off along the cliff path in the direction of Portreath. The wind had dropped, and the sky cleared since morning; the sun was shining, and the air was very fresh and cool after the rain.
   Rather to his surprise, Hamilton found his troubles slipping off his shoulders as he strove to enter into the gay spirit of her conversation, and before long he was laughing as merrily as she. He found her a delightful companion, and before they had been out an hour they were firm friends.
   It was not until they had turned on to the inland road, and were walking homewards between the high banks, that she mentioned Kestrel.
   “What’s going on there, Mr. Hamilton? Do tell me; Uncle’s so mysterious. I know you went over there this morning, and you looked so worried this afternoon.”
   He looked down at her clear grey eyes, turned so confidently upon his face, and mentally vowed that she should never know anything of the horror that dwelt on Kestrel, but he knew that he could never lie to her, so, man-like, he temporized:
   “Well, Tony — that’s Sir Anthony, of course — he’s an old pal of mine, and he’s got himself into a bit of a jam. His father had a sort of nervous breakdown before he died, and Tony asked me to send down a psycho-therapist from London. I was put on to this Dr. Gaunt. He came down and hasbeen here ever since. It seems that he’s a bit of a spiritualist, and is rather keen on solving the mystery of the Lovell family curse, and Tony’s got mixed up with the whole cranky business, and I’m a bit worried about him. That’s all.”
   She laughed.
   “That doesn’t sound very serious. People do get caught up in these things, I know. A girl friend of mine in Bristol did once — séances, and all that sort of thing. Very creepy! But she soon got tired of it. I expect your friend will too.”
   “I sincerely hope so,” said Hamilton, and meant it.
   They said no more about the matter then, but went on chattering happily about other things. About a mile from the rectory, however, Valerie gave a little cry of pain and nearly fell. Hamilton caught her in a moment, and she stood on one leg, ruefully looking down at her left shoe. She had caught it between two stones in the rutty road, and the heel was twisted off. He knelt down in the dust and tried to put it back again, but it was hopeless, and so they went slowly on, she clinging to his arm.
   He found it very pleasant to help her thus, and privately blessed the unwitting stones which had caused the little accident. Her slight weight on his arm made him feel large and heroic. Mentally he called himself an ass, but the fact was undeniable.
   As they approached the rectory gate she suddenly became very quiet, and seemed to press closer to him than was absolutely necessary. Wondering what happy conclusion he could deduce from this, he stopped, and held the gate open for her. Without saying a word she released his arm and dived her hand into his jacket pocket. Dumbly he submitted, as the truth flashed blindingly across his mind, and watched her draw out the heavy pistol, whose bulky shape she had felt against her side.
   For a long moment they stood there, a strange little tableau; he tense and expectant, she facing him, looking down at the grim object in her small hands. Then she shivered, and looked up at him, her face white; and he took the gun from her.
   “Are your articles so violent that you must needs go armed, Mr. Hamilton?” she asked.
   He did not reply, but still held the gate open for her. She passed through, and he followed, but as they entered the house she spoke again:
   “Spiritualism, you said, Mr. Hamilton?”
   He could find no words to answer her.
   Chapter XIII
   I
   Next morning Hamilton received a note from Lorrimer. He was sitting on a bench outside the inn enjoying the warm sunshine when he saw the man Tregellis climbing the steep street towards him. He got up and went to meet him, and the other took the letter from his pocket, saying:
   “From Mr. Lorrimer, sir.”
   The message was brief, and ran as follows:
   Mr. Hamilton, sir,
   Sir Anthony and the others returned yesterday, just after you left. They did not ask if you had been, so I suppose they did not know that you are in the village. They all went down to the crypt last night, and were there a long time. Sir Anthony is much changed; you would scarcely know him, sir. I will communicate any further developments at once.
   Hamilton folded the note thoughtfully and put it in his pocket, telling Tregellis that there would be no answer, and made his way to the rectory. He could see no other course than to wait from something to turn up, but he hated the inaction, and Tony might be inextricably involved while he sat still and did nothing.
   He found the rector digging in the front garden and gave him the note. The old man read it through carefully and then tore it into small fragments.
   “It tells us very little,” said he. “You will observe that ‘Sir Anthony is much changed’. I have no doubt that he is now initiated, and realizes to what he has committed himself. He could hardly be otherwise than changed, poor boy. I don’t think we can rely upon their not knowing you are here. If they are as clever as I think they will be perfectly well aware of our movements. No, we can do nothing at present. The next move is theirs.”
   Hamilton was forced to agree, and the rector continued:
   “I think you had better go and speak to Valerie. You will find her round at the back somewhere. She made me tell her the whole story last night after you had gone. It was careless of you to leave that pistol in your pocket, but perhaps it is as well that she should know.”
   “How did she take it?” Hamilton asked anxiously.
   “Rather badly at first, I’m sorry to say. It was an unpleasant shock for her — she did not suspect that such things happened at all; but she is better now. She wants to see you.”
   Hamilton left him and walked round the side of the house. When he came to the lawn at the back he saw the girl sitting on a garden seat, apparently deep in thought, for she did not look up as he approached. Without saying anything he sat down beside her and began to fill his pipe. Presently she spoke, not looking at him, but staring straight in front of her.
   “Uncle told me everything last night.”
   “Yes, I know.” Hamilton struck a match.
   “Oh, how can you sit still, smoking your pipe, while out there a soul is being ruined for ever?” she burst out with surprising vehemence. “You’re as bad as Uncle. ‘Pray’, he says. What good will that do? It’s — its’ damnable!” She finished with a half-sob, and suddenly burst into tears, burying her face in her hands. Hamilton felt an almost uncontrollable desire to take her in his arms and comfort her, but he merely bit his pipe-stem hard and said quietly:
   “Your uncle is right, Miss Bennett. Things are rather out of our hands now. They are so much more powerful than we are; we can do nothing against them in our own strength. But God will help us, if we trust Him.”
   “Then why does He let such things go on at all? I never knew that there were such people as these — these Satanists.”
   “It’s very hard, I know,” he answered, “but don’t you see that it explains a good deal of the misery and horror of this world, that such people as these deliberately take sides against God, and help to bring about the Devil’s plans?”
   “But why should only they have this awful power? Why shouldn’t decent people be able to fight them with their own weapons?”
   “I suppose because it’s easier to gain this power by submitting to the Devil,” said Hamilton slowly. He was not very sure of his ground, being almost as new to this as she was, but the rector had tried to explain to him also, and he desperately wanted to help her in her trouble.
   “Great saints have had material power,” he went on, “but we ordinary people would probably only misuse it if we had it, so God doesn’t let us have the chance. The Devil is only too ready to help his own.”
   “I suppose that must be it” — she spoke more calmly now — “but I can’t bear to think of that poor boy all alone at the mercy of such monsters.”
   “Do you think it is any easier for me?” he asked. “Tony was my friend — you have not yet even met him — and since it was I who was responsible in the first place for Gaunt’s coming down here, I feel partly to blame for the whole affair.”
   She was instantly contrite.
   “I’m so sorry — of course it’s much worse for you. I’d no idea you felt like that about it. It was beastly of me to turn and rend you. Please forgive me!”
   “With all my heart, Valerie.”
   “Thank you — John.” She glanced sideways at him, half-shyly, as she used his name, and he felt a sudden glow of warmth about his heart.
   “Shall we try and forget all about it for the present?” he asked. “Worrying won’t do any good at all; we’ve done all we can; the rest lies with God.”
   “I’ll do my best,” she answered, “but you must help me, John.”
   “We’ll help each other, Valerie,” said he.
   So began a very happy companionship, born not only of their mutual physical attraction, but of a very real spiritual need which both felt.
   The weather had taken a turn for the better, and during the next week they spent most of their time together, out of doors.
   They went for long walks over the bleak moors, peering fearfully down the abandoned mine-shafts which scarred them, and exploring the ruined engine-houses. They climbed the gaunt granite tors, and scrambled over the weird-shaped masses of rock, finding sheltered crannies in which to unpack their picnic basket. They bathed from a secluded cove a mile or so north of Pentock, where there was a beach of firm, golden sand, and the sea was free from rocks. Here they would splash about in the clear, shallow water, warm as milk, or swim together out to sea when the tide was favourable. Then, pleasantly tired with the exertion, they would dry in the hot sun, talking sometimes, but more often silent in their perfect comradeship. At such times Valerie looked more intoxicatingly lovely than ever, with her dark curls lying damp about her face, and her lithe body and slim legs, delicately tanned, set off to perfection by the white costume which she wore.
   Hamilton knew he was fast falling in love with her, and he was content that it should be so. Whether his feelings were reciprocated he did not know, but the light in her eyes and the look on her face sometimes gave him much cause for hope. And so the days passed.
   One morning Valerie said she would like to go for a sail. Hamilton doubted the wisdom of this, since his boating experience was limited to yachting on the Broads, but he was long past denying her anything; so, without consulting the rector, they packed a luncheon-basket and crept out like two naughty children. They managed to hire a dinghy down at the harbour, and after lengthy instructions from the boatman about the tides they set sail. The harbour mouth was negotiated successfully, and in a few minutes they were out in the open sea. There was a fresh breeze, and the sea was rather choppy, but by avoiding the shore and keeping well out Hamilton thought they would be safe enough.
   He set his course for the north, giving Kestrel a wide berth, and for a couple of hours they glided along happily. The only other boat in sight was a coal-barge— from Cardiff he guessed, making for Portreath. Presently that disappeared, and they had the sea to themselves; the distant rocky coast on their right and Kestrel behind them.
   Shortly after noon they opened the basket and had lunch. Then Hamilton lay down in the bottom of the boat, one hand on the tiller, smoking his pipe and lazily watching Valerie, who was perched in the bows; a delightful picture in her white sweater and short blue skirt. Overhead two seagulls sailed in the deep blue, their wings flashing in the sun. It was very peaceful.
   Then the wind dropped. For a while they waited hopefully, but the calm continued, so Hamilton lowered the empty sail and got out the oars. They were perhaps five miles from Pentock, and he was settling down to what promised to be a long and tiresome job, when the wind began to blow again, in short gusts, from the land.
   Shipping the oars, he hoisted the sail once more, but soon found that tacking was well-nigh impossible, to one of his small skill, in such an uncertain and violent wind. After twice going within an ace of capsizing them he gave it up, lowered the sail, and began to row again.
   He had his back to the wind, and consequently did not see the great bank of cloud which piled swiftly up, but the girl was watching it intently, and when it finally obscured the sun she voiced the apprehension which had been troubling her.
   “Are we in for a storm, John?” she asked in a small voice.
   Hamilton gave one swift look over his shoulder and went on pulling harder than ever.
   “Afraid so,” he muttered. “If only we weren’t so far out!”
   As he spoke great drops of rain began splashing on to the boat, and in the heart of the dark cloud overhead there was a little violet flicker, followed in a few seconds by a distant rumble. The wind increased, and began lashing the grey sea to fury.
   Soon Hamilton drew in the oars; it was quite hopeless trying to row in the welter of water upon which the dinghy tossed. He crawled over the thwarts to where Valerie was crouching in the stern, taking the tiller from her, and trying to keep the boat head on to the gale. Even then mountainous waves threatened to overwhelm them every second.
   The sky was now like ink, and the shore invisible through the driving rain. The thunder crashed and rolled, while the lightning flickered incessantly.
   Hamilton put his free arm round Valerie, and she pressed close against him. He could feel her trembling slightly, but her voice was quite steady as she spoke into his ear above the tumult of the storm.
   “Do you think we shall come through, John?”
   He nodded vigorously, saying with an assurance he was far from feeling:
   “Of course we shall come through. This’ll soon blow over.”
   Then he had to leave her and bail out the water, which was rapidly filling the bottom of the boat.
   For what seemed like hours they kept up the unequal battle with the elements. They lost all count of time, for Hamilton’s wrist-watch had stopped long ago, but at last the darkness became absolute, save when the lightning lit up the waste of heaving water with its weird blue glare. Night had fallen.
   Soaked to the skin, shivering with cold and terror, they huddled together in the bottom of the boat. A cross-wave had carried away the rudder, and they were at the mercy of the wind. Hamilton cursed himself bitterly for ever having allowed her to persuade him to this mad adventure. Unless a miracle happened they were lost.
   A deeper roaring rose above the noise of the wind— a crashing, seething sound. Breakers! He pulled himself up to the level of the gunwale and saw, in the brief blue glare, the black bulk of Kestrel, with the Abbey perched atop, hard on the leeward bow. Nothing could save them now, he thought; they were rushing straight to destruction on the cruel rocks. This was the end!
   Howling like a demon, the wind caught the boat and lifted it broadside on the crest of a mighty wave. As they turned over he saw the welter of foam and the black rocks beneath.
   II
   “But, Doctor, you know I don’t like these anthropomorphic ceremonies.”
   Anthony Lovell was the speaker. He sat facing Dr. Gaunt in front of the roaring fire in the library. Outside the wind was yelling round the walls of Kestrel, mingling with the ceaseless roar of the surf at the foot of the cliffs. The resultant tumult penetrated the Abbey to such an extent that the speakers had to raise their voices a little, and pause altogether when the thunder shook the building to its foundations.
   “No, Tony, I know you don’t,” Gaunt answered, after one of these interruptions. “Neither do I. But Vaughan does. I suppose it’s a survival from the days when he was a priest. He loves ceremonial, and the Black Mass particularly.”
   “But it effects nothing; it has no use.”
   “Save on the mind of the celebrant and those present. It is true that a great adept can dispense entirely with ceremonial — even I can sometimes; but Vaughan and yourself are not sufficiently advanced yet.”
   “But so much of the ritual seems quite childish and fantastic.”
   The doctor smiled.
   “I know. So does all ritual. Even our little human acts and gestures by which we express our emotions — love, fear, laughter, and so on — are quite absurd if viewed in a detached manner. But ritual is helpful. These time-honoured ceremonies of ours are merely a means by which we focus, and concentrate into action, all the latent powers of the soul.”
   “Yes, Doctor, I know all that. It is only against this pointless Black Mass that I am protesting.”
   “Well, Tony, Simon believes it to be necessary for you to assist him at it, in order to carry on with our work of banishing the curse-elemental from the island. After all, he is in charge of the job, and we must let him carry it out in his own way. The Mass is merely a rather unpleasant survival of our great rebellion against the soul-destroying bondage of the Catholic religion, and Vaughan likes to use it as a means of reminding himself of his escape from that bondage. We must humour him, Tony.”
   “Very well, I’ll do it, but under protest. When does he want to begin?”
   “Tonight; now, I fancy. Shall we join him? He’s down below.”
   They rose and went out together. As they entered the passage leading to the hall the kitchen door burst open and Lorrimer appeared, clad in oilskins, and dripping wet.
   “What on earth’s the matter, Lorrimer?” asked Tony.
   Between gasps, for he had just run up the stairway from the harbour, the servant told him.
   “Tom and I were just letting down the water-gate, Sir Anthony, when a great wave carried a little boat clean over.”
   “Great Scott! Anybody in it?”
   “Yes, Sir Anthony, a man and a woman. It took us a long time to fish them out, and they were pretty far gone, sir. Tom’s with them now.”
   “Come on, Doctor!” cried Tony. “We must lend a hand.” He followed Lorrimer into the kitchen and struggled into another oilskin. Gaunt shrugged his shoulders and followed also, a little frown of annoyance on his face.
   “Bring them up here, gently,” he said. “I’ll wait for you. Mrs. Lorrimer, hot blankets and brandy, please.”
   Outside the wind was terrific, and it was all Tony could do to keep his feet as he stumbled down the worn steps after Lorrimer’s torch.
   Down on the landing-stage two bedraggled figures were stretched out near a hurricane lamp. Tregellis was kneeling astride one of them, applying artificial respiration. Every few seconds a tremendous wave would burst in the harbour mouth, flinging a shower of spray over the group.
   Tregellis greeted Lorrimer with a shout.
   “The other’s breathing now; this one isn’t.”
   Motioning him to help Lorrimer, Tony took over the seemingly hopeless task. He had set his hands upon her back, and was hard at work, before he realized that it was a girl who lay, apparently lifeless, between his knees. Lorrimer and Tregellis picked up the other castaway and staggered off up the steps.
   It seemed to Tony that he knelt over that frail body for hours, pressing and relaxing in the endless effort to restart the water-logged lungs. The noise of the sea was frightful, and the flickering lightning rendered the lamp practically useless, so dazzling was it. Tregellis had returned and had been standing beside him for some time when Tony was at last rewarded by a choking sigh as the girl struggled painfully back to life. He staggered to his feet, numb with cold and almost exhausted, while the other gathered up the slight figure. Together they climbed the stairway, Tony lighting the way.
   In the kitchen the doctor was kneeling beside the first patient, forcing brandy between the blue lips. He got up when Tregellis entered carrying the girl, but was forestalled by Mrs. Lorrimer, who bustled forward, making little sounds of pity. It was she who drove them all out save the doctor, while she stripped the saturated clothing from the slim body and wrapped her in a warm blanket.
   When Tony came in again the two castaways were lying side by side in front of the great range, and Gaunt was ministering to them both.
   “How are they, Doctor?” he asked.
   “They’ll be all right. There’s nothing seriously wrong now except for exposure and exhaustion. You undoubtedly saved the girl’s life, though; she was nearly gone, Tregellis tells me.”
   “Good!” said Tony, and peered closer at the faces of the couple. He uttered a great cry, and sprang erect.
   “Why, Doctor, it’s John Hamilton! You remember —?”
   “Of course I remember,” Gaunt replied quietly, “I recognized him at once.”
   “But what an extraordinary thing — ”
   “Is it, Tony? Nothing is extraordinary in this fantastic world. I might have anticipated something like this.”
   “What do you mean, Doctor?”
   “Nothing. Help me get them to bed. Mrs. Lorrimer is preparing two rooms over here. They will be warmer than anywhere else.”
   So that night Hamilton and Valerie lay on Kestrel isle, in a deep coma of utter exhaustion, unaware that they had been miraculously saved from a watery grave.* * *
   When Valerie awoke she found herself in a low, cosy room with stone walls and narrow, uncurtained windows, and a cheerful fire making dancing patterns on the ceiling. A grey light was struggling in from outside, but a lamp still burnt beside the bed.
   She looked round in drowsy wonder, and a kind-faced, grey-haired woman came to her side, carrying a great bowl of soup.
   “Drink this, my dear, and don’t talk.”
   Valerie obeyed both commands, and lay back, feeling deliciously lazy, and far too sleepy to think. A tall, dark man, with silver-streaked hair and piercing eyes, came in and sat by the bedside, feeling her pulse. She supposed she had been ill and that this was the doctor, but where she was she hadn’t the faintest notion. Then the doctor told her to go to sleep, and without more ado she did so.
   Gaunt got up and went into the adjoining room, where he sat down beside the still-sleeping Hamilton, gently taking the young man’s hands in his.
   For a long time he sat thus, his look withdrawn and his lips moving slightly. Then he called to Mrs. Lorrimer, who came in with another bowl of soup. Hamilton opened his eyes and sat up, staring around. He recognized them both, and remembered instantly— the boat, the storm, the rocks and —
   “Valerie! Is she safe?”
   “Quite safe, my boy,” answered Gaunt, “asleep in the next room. Now drink this, and try to get some more sleep.”
   Reassured, Hamilton obediently drank his soup, and was soon asleep once more.
   The doctor went back to Valerie, and repeated the process he had performed with her companion-in-distress, holding her hands and whispering softly, his glittering eyes fixed upon her quiet face.
   When he joined his colleague Vaughan in the great hall he was smiling with satisfaction. The other noticed this at once and asked:
   “You have been successful, then?”
   Gaunt laughed softly.
   “Eminently so, my friend,” he said. “They knew a little, and suspected — much. When they wake again they will know nothing and suspect less. All is well.”
   “Did you have any difficulty with Hamilton?”
   “Very little. He was so exhausted that I overcame his will almost at once. The girl was easy.”
   Chapter XIV
   When Hamilton woke again he found Tony sitting beside him. As soon as he opened his eyes the other spoke.
   “Well, John, feeling better?”
   Hamilton stretched luxuriously.
   “I feel fine now, Tony, thanks. How is Valerie — Miss Bennett?”
   “The girl who was with you? She’d doing very well. Who is she, John?”
   “Niece of the rector at Pentock. An awfully nice girl.”
   “So I should imagine. How on earth did you come to be out in that storm?”
   Hamilton related the story, and then Tony told him how they had been saved from the deep.
   “It’s little short of miraculous that you’re here at all, John,” he concluded.
   “Yes. And we owe our lives to you and your servants, Tony. If they hadn’t fished us out of the harbour we should certainly have been drowned. Is the storm over yet?”
   Tony went to the window and looked out. It was late afternoon, but the sky was a uniform slate colour, and the gale was still raging furiously. The continuous thunder of the surf could be plainly heard.
   “It’s still very rough, John,” said he. “I suppose you want to get back as soon as possible?”
   “Yes, or at least to get a message to Father Bennett.”
   “No chance of that yet, I’m afraid,” answered Tony. “We couldn’t possibly get across in the launch. It may be days before we can get in touch. We’ve been cut off here before after a storm like yesterday’s.”
   “That’s awkward. The rector will have given us up for lost. However, it can’t be helped. We shall have to trespass still further on your hospitality for a while, that’s all.”
   “You’re welcome to stay as long as you like, John. Now I must be off. You mustn’t talk too much yet.”
   After the door had closed behind his friend Hamilton lay thinking how fortunate they were to have fallen into such good hands. For a moment a vague recollection of something unpleasant that he had read or heard— he couldn’t be sure which — about Kestrel rose in his mind, but he dismissed it at once. It was very good to lie here, warm and comfortable, after the hell of the previous night, watching the cheerful glow of the fire, and knowing that Valerie was safe in the next room.
   At about the same hour Valerie also woke to find Mrs. Lorrimer still with her. At first she was just as puzzled as on the occasion of her first awakening, and asked where she was.
   Mrs. Lorrimer put down her sewing and turned towards her.
   “Ah, so, you’re awake now, my dear,” she said. “Don’t worry, you’re quite safe. You’re on Kestrel Island; my husband helped pull you and Mr. Hamilton out of the sea last night.”
   Recollection came back with a rush, and the girl’s face whitened.
   “John — is he safe?” she breathed.
   “Yes, my dear. Quite safe and sound. You’re both very fortunate to be alive at all. You were in God’s hands last night.”
   Valerie lay and contemplated the wonder of it. They were safe, and here she was, on Kestrel Island, actually within the walls of the Abbey, that fairy castle of romance which she had so often gazed at longingly from the mainland. It was almost too good to be true.
   “Is old Sir Anthony here?” she asked.
   “No, my dear; he’s dead now, you know, and his son is master of Kestrel.”
   “Yes, of course. How silly of me! John’s friend — I had forgotten.”
   It was not the only thing she had forgotten, for all memory of the dark mystery which surrounded Tony and his associates had been blotted out of her mind, as out of Hamilton’s, by the iron will of Dr. Gaunt.
   Presently there came a knock at the door, and Tony’s voice was heard asking if he might come in. Mrs. Lorrimer looked inquiringly at Valerie, who nodded shyly, and she bade him enter.
   Half diffidently he opened the door and approached the bed. While he was asking how she was— and she was thanking him prettily for his hospitality — she was thinking: “So this is John’s friend… now nice!”
   “I’ve just been with John,” he went on. “He’s awake and feeling very fit. I expect the doctor will let you both get up tomorrow.”
   When he had gone Mrs. Lorrimer told her how he had battled with death over her unconscious body, and she was filled with a great tenderness towards the young man.
   Dr. Gaunt was the next visitor, and expressed himself much pleased with their condition.
   Downstairs he confirmed Tony’s guess that they might get up the following morning. Tony was highly delighted and remarked that he didn’t mind how long they had to stay. To Gaunt’s suggestion that they should carry on with the interrupted ceremony of last night he made an impatient reply.
   “No, Doctor, that can wait until they’ve gone. There’s plenty of time before the twenty-fifth. She’s very lovely, isn’t she?”
   The other nodded and turned his head away, so that Tony should not see the frown of annoyance he could not suppress. This delay was not at all to his liking.
   He said as much to Vaughan when next they were alone, but that gentleman was inclined to agree with Tony that they had better wait.
   Next morning the whole party met at the breakfast-table. Mrs. Lorrimer had dried and pressed Valerie’s clothes, and she looked very charming. Tony, in particular, could not keep his eyes off her. Hamilton, in a suit of Tony’s, which did not fit him very well, was quite left out of the conversation which they kept up and was forced to fall back on Dr. Gaunt. Vaughan, after the first introductions, said little, but he too kept turning his sleepy eyes in Valerie’s direction.
   After the meal Tony bore Valerie off to show her the Abbey, and Hamilton went with the others to the great hall, where they sat round the cavernous hearth smoking and talking. He found them delightful company, and time passed quickly. Outside the wind still roared with scarcely abated vigour, and with the dull pounding of the waves made a continual background to their conversation.
   When the two young people joined them the girl’s face was flushed, and her eyes were shining with excitement.
   “Oh, John,” she exclaimed, “isn’t this a marvelous place? You are lucky, Tony, to be able to stay here whenever you want to.”
   Hamilton noticed the“Tony” with a little pang of jealousy, but immediately reproached himself for the thought. He told himself he should be glad that she was getting on so well with his friend.
   “It’s all so ancient and splendid, somehow,” she went on. “But tell me, surely there’s some legend about a ghost or something, isn’t there?”
   Tony flashed a quick look at Gaunt, who nodded slightly.
   “Well, we’ve no real ghosts, as far as I know,” he answered. “But I suppose you are thinking of the family curse. It is said to have taken the form of a monster which inhabits the caves under the Abbey.”
   Valerie clapped her hands delightedly.
   “Oh, how perfectly splendid!” she cried. “It only wanted that to make it quite perfect. Have you ever seen it, Tony?”
   “No,” he answered slowly, “I can’t say I have. But you must ask Vaughan about that. He knows all about these things, and he’s actually come down here to investigate it.”
   “Really, Mr. Vaughan?” She turned to him, her big grey eyes suddenly serious. “Are you one of those psychic research people?”
   Vaughan gave a fat chuckle, and removed his cheroot.
   “Only an amateur, Miss Bennett,” said he. “I’ve studied these matters quite a lot, though, and I may say that I hope to expel the curse in time.”
   “Oh, but you mustn’t! Or at least, if you do, don’t tell anyone it’s gone. All old houses must have their family ghost, you know.”
   “I think you could do without yours, eh, Tony?” Vaughan’s thick voice was quizzical.
   “Yes, I think I could,” Tony replied quietly.
   “Have you seen it, then, Mr. Vaughan?” Valerie demanded.
   “Once, Miss Bennett. But I’d rather not talk about it, if you don’t mind. It’s not a very pleasant subject.”
   “But how are you going to get rid of it?” she insisted. “I mean it’s not like rats, or dry-rot, or anything, is it?”
   “I am making my preparations. I shall be delighted to show them to you some time.”
   “Where are they?”
   “Down in the crypt below here.”
   “I should be frightfully scared.” She shivered. “But it’s most awfully thrilling, isn’t it, John? Let’s all go down, this afternoon.”
   “Very well, Miss Bennett, if you wish it,” said Vaughan, and adroitly changed the subject.
   But Valerie did not forget the promise, and after lunch they all descended to the crypt.
   Hamilton was surprised to find how familiar it all seemed, since he could not remember ever having been down there before.
   Valerie was vastly intrigued by the elaborate diagram, upon which they walked quite freely, and by the seals on the altar. Vaughan explained them to her in a vague manner, using terms with which she was unfamiliar, and finally she gave up the effort of following him and confessed that it was too deep for her. She asked if they could go on into the caverns beneath, but Vaughan promptly quashed the suggestion with a vivid account of the dangers of falling rocks and hidden pitfalls.
   In the evening they played bridge, while Vaughan sat reading, and all retired early to bed, the two castaways keeping their original rooms to avoid troubling Mrs. Lorrimer unduly.
   As Hamilton was climbing into bed there came a knock at his door, and Lorrimer entered.
   “Pardon the intrusion, sir,” he said, “but I’ve been trying to speak to you all day, and this is the first chance I’ve had to see you alone.”
   Hamilton stared at him. What on earth did the fellow want?
   “I’m very glad you’re here, sir,” the other continued; “Sir Anthony is quite a different man since you came. You got my note all right, sir?”
   “What note? What are you talking about, man?”
   Lorrimer was amazed.
   “The note about Sir Anthony, sir, and his friends that you asked me to write when you came over to find out what was going on. You agreed with me at the time, sir, that he was not keeping good company.”
   “I’m not in the habit of discussing my friend’s affairs with their servants, Lorrimer,” said Hamilton indignantly. “That will be all, thank you.”
   The old man stared at him, hurt astonishment written large upon his face. He bowed, saying:
   “I’m very sorry, sir, if I’ve spoken out of place. Good night, sir.”
   After he had gone Hamilton lit his pipe and smoked awhile, deep in thought. What had the man been driving at? Did he mean Gaunt and Vaughan? Surely not; they were charming fellows, both. He remembered his first visit to the island, and why he had left, well enough; but the second visit, and all that he had learnt from the rector, were completely forgotten. He supposed that Tony was still going on with his new studies, and hoped that he was progressing favourably. Certainly he looked very well, and his face had acquired far more character than it had had in the old days. Still puzzling over Lorrimer’s ambiguity, he fell asleep.
   In a room not very far away Lorrimer was talking to his wife.
   “Stared at me quite blank, he did, as if I was a piece of dirt, and then ordered me out.”
   “Don’t take it to heart, James,” she consoled him. “He may be acting a part. Or else…”
   “What?”
   “They have been getting at him too.”
   “God help us if they have!”
   “He will, James, never fear.”* * *
   Valerie had a strange dream that night: she dreamed she was in an endless winding passage, cut out of the solid rock, whose walls dripped with slime and were rotten with luminous fungi. She dreamed, moreover, that something abominable was pursuing her, some nightmare creature that slithered along the rocky floor at lightning speed. She tried to run, but her feet were like lead; she could only drag them painfully, a few inches at a time. She opened her mouth to scream, but her throat dried up, and her tongue refused its office. Half crazed with terror, she looked behind her to see the horror assume the form and features of Simon Vaughan. The sensual lips leered wickedly at her, the podgy hands outstretched to clutch. Then Anthony Lovell caught her in his arms, and the pursuer vanished. She clung to her rescuer, sobbing incoherently, while he stroked her hair and whispered endearments to her. Presently she became calm; he kissed her lips, and she found his kisses strangely sweet.
   When she woke the narrow windows of her room still framed only darkness, but the dying fire lit the room with a warm glow. The impression that Tony was still near her was so strong that she sat up, staring round, but the room was empty save for herself. Smiling sleepily at her own foolishness, she lay down and slept dreamlessly till dawn.
   But in his distant room Tony lay on his back, staring wide-eyed into the darkness. Using the powers which he now possessed, he had deliberately projected himself into her dreams, but the vision had been brief and unsatisfying.
   Ever since he had dragged her back from the jaws of death two nights ago, he had known that there was no other woman in the world for him, and he was greatly troubled. He could see quite plainly that Hamilton loved her, but whether she returned his friend’s love he could not tell. He wanted her desperately, and for the first time since he had begun this new life of his he began to wonder whether it were everything that he had imagined.
   He possessed the power, he knew, to subject her to his will and to bring her, even now, to him; but his soul revolted from the thought of making her an unwilling victim to his desire. She must come willingly, or not at all. But the temptation was great, and he lay wrestling with it until the first grey light of dawn, when at last he fell asleep, worn out by his struggle, but so far victorious.* * *
   The next day passed very much like its predecessor. The storm had abated somewhat, but the sea was still far too rough to attempt the crossing.
   In the afternoon Hamilton, Valerie, and Tony went for a scramble across the island, laughing breathlessly as they struggled over the uneven ground in the teeth of the gale.
   While they were gone Gaunt and Vaughan held a council of war.
   “I am greatly troubled, Simon,” announced the doctor. “There is but a week to go before the anniversary, and he has not yet assisted at the Mass.”
   “The girl, Doctor.”
   “Precisely. She is affecting his whole outlook on the situation. From being his whole life, it has become quite secondary. He has fallen in love with her.”
   “She must be removed.”
   “Yes, and not only from this island, but from his life altogether. Since she will stay at Pentock with her uncle when she leaves us, she must be destroyed utterly.”
   “How?” Vaughan leaned forward, his coarse face ablaze with eagerness.
   Gaunt placed his fingertips carefully together and replied in measured tones:
   “I propose to work upon her expressed desire to visit the caves beneath the crypt, and to send her down there, tonight, alone. The monstrosity will make short work of her, and no one will be the wiser.”
   “Could I not have her first, Doctor?” Vaughan passed the tip of his tongue over his thick red lips. “Her naked body would be a most suitable adornment for the altar.”
   “No!” said Gaunt curtly. “We have no time for such frivolities. It must be done quickly.”
   A shade of disappointment passed over the other’s face.
   “Very well, Doctor,” he sighed. “At what hour?”
   “At 1 a.m. tomorrow. You will be ready?”
   “Yes, Doctor, I will be ready.”
   And so it came about that, when Valerie had been in bed and asleep for a couple of hours, she awoke with one consuming idea in her mind: to see for herself what lay beneath the altar in the crypt.
   She got up and slipped on the heavy woolen dressing-gown which Mrs. Lorrimer had lent her, thrusting her feet into a pair of slippers. Lighting the oil-lamp which stood by her bed, she took it up and went silently out, down the staircase to the warm kitchen and along the cold passage to the great hall. The fact that the stone trap which gave access to the crypt stood open did not appear to surprise her unduly, and she made her way down the spiral stairs. There was no fear in her heart, no foreboding of the frightful danger she was walking into, but only that one burning desire which dominated her whole being and must be fulfilled.
   With unerring steps she went straight to the altar. The seals were broken, and the upper slab stood on end. She went up the low steps, set her lamp on the broad edge of the altar-side, and climbed lithely over. Taking up the lamp once more, she fearlessly descended the steps within.
   When the last faint reflection of her lamp was gone Gaunt and his colleague emerged from their hiding-place behind one of the near-by pillars, lowered the altar-stone into place, and, without a word, returned to the doctor’s room. There on the table Gaunt’s crystal stood ready, and they sat down, one on either side. Gazing into its opalescent depths, they followed Valerie’s progress through the caves.
   The girl was walking cautiously along, holding the lamp in her left hand and with her right drawing her gown close about her, for the air was bitterly cold. Her eyes were fixed on the uneven floor. She did not hesitate at the division of the tunnel, but turned to the left and went boldly on. As she penetrated deeper, so the cold grew more intense, and the peculiar odour which she had noticed from the first grew stronger; but still she went on, driven by the will behind those glittering eyes which stared unwinkingly into the crystal as they watched her fatal progress.
   She was approaching the bend which came before the opening into the great cavern when she encountered a wave of cold so intense that she stopped involuntarily, gasping for breath. So violent was the shock that her numbed fingers loosed their hold upon the lamp and it fell to the ground, smashing into fragments and plunging her into total darkness.
   As this catastrophe occurred the spell which had held her was broken, and she regained full possession of her faculties. She realized at once where she was, for she could remember her journey thither with perfect clarity, though what had made her undertake such a foolhardy expedition she was at a loss to understand. Even then she was not particularly frightened, for her upbringing had left her singularly free from superstitious fears. And, merely wondering if she would ever be able to find her way back in the dark, she began to retrace her steps, feeling her way along the slippery wall.
   The watchers looked at each other.
   “She is not afraid,” Vaughan whispered, incredulous wonder in his heart. “It cannot feel her presence if she is not afraid… She will escape.”
   “No!” Gaunt fairly spat out the monosyllable and bent his gaze once more on the crystal.
   Instantly Valerie’s eyes were opened and she remembered all that she had forgotten about Kestrel, all that Gaunt had made her forget and which he now willed her to remember. She realized that she and Hamilton were in the very stronghold of the Satanists; sleeping under the same roof, breaking bread, laughing and talking with the forgotten of God, the Devil-worshipers, the accursed. She remembered that this island was under interdict, bereft of grace; that for four centuries the sacraments had been absent from this soil; and that in the bowels of the Abbey rock, where she now stood, a horror of great darkness dwelt. With a little broken cry she sank to the ground and huddled against the wall, praying frantically for help.
   But no help came. Instead the solid rock began to quake, and a faint greenish glow lit up the tunnel. Through her closed eyelids she saw the hellish radiance, and twisting her head beheld with starting eyes the monstrous Thing which was crawling up behind her. Lit with its own horrid light it came, a living stream of putrefaction, a tidal wave of darkness, filling the tunnel from wall to wall, writhing and quivering with abominable purpose.
   Had she stayed and faced it, calling upon God for help, it is impossible to say what the outcome would have been, but it was more than mortal flesh could bear. With one shriek of pure terror she was on her feet and flying headlong up the passage.It was her dream come true.
   Twice she caught her foot on the boulder-strewn floor and fell headlong, but each time she struggled up, numb with fear and regardless of her bruises.
   When she reached the foot of the steps leading up to the crypt she was on the verge of collapse, her breath sobbing in her throat and her heart pounding chokingly, but with renewed hope she dragged herself up towards safety.
   The altar-stone was down. She was trapped!
   At the foot of the steps the horror was surging, swelling and crawling up. As it came, so the awful Personality which dwelt in the veil of darkness which was its substance mocked at her helplessness.
   Frantically she beat upon the cruel, unyielding stone above her, until her little hands were bleeding. Then at last her strength failed utterly and she fell senseless on the upper step.
   Nicholas Gaunt rose from his chair and flung a velvet cloth over the crystal.
   “That, I think, is that, my friend,” he said calmly, but his voice exulted despite himself.
   Simon Vaughan sat huddled up, his hands locked together, his features rigid. A thin stream of saliva ran down his chin. When he raised his great head there was horror in his eyes.
   “She was so beautiful,” he said dully.
   Gaunt laughed harshly, flinging himself upon the bed, and drew out his cigarette-case.
   Chapter XV
   When Tony went to bed that night his spirit was in a turmoil. He thought that once or twice during the day Valerie had looked at him with something more than mere friendship in her lovely eyes. He scarcely dared to hope, but the thought that she might conceivably return his love well-nigh intoxicated him.
   She filled his mind utterly now. Everything else took second place: the great work he was engaged upon, the new philosophy of life he had accepted— all became dream-like and unreal. Was it indeed he, he asked himself incredulously, who had stood in that secret temple in far-off London, vowing to serve none other than the powers of darkness? It could not be. A slender, grey-eyed girl had come into his life, and at one touch had dispelled the murky shadows which clouded it. Her, and her only, would he serve… and she was light, not darkness.
   Before going to sleep he toyed for a moment with the idea of visiting her in dream as he had done before, but he dismissed the thought as unworthy. Rigidly composing his mind, he fell into a troubled slumber.
   Some hours later he awoke suddenly and sat bolt upright, staring into the darkness. Was it imagination, born of his anxious love, or had he indeed heard Valerie’s voice calling for help in accents of desperate terror?
   His heart beat thunderously in his ears, and he trembled in every limb, but, steeling his will, he thrust his mind out from him into the night, feeling for her whereabouts. Her room was empty. Where was she? Desperately he cast around, using every trick he had learnt from Gaunt. Then he saw.
   With a smothered cry he leapt out of bed, snatched up his torch, tore open the door, and rushed headlong towards the staircase. Down the stairs he flew, his bare feet padding on the stones. A moment’s struggle with the trap and he was winding down the spiral into the crypt. Darting between the squat pillars, his torch throwing a brilliant splash of light before him, he reached the altar. Precious seconds were wasted struggling with the hidden catch that secured the top, but soon he swung itupwards on its balanced pivot and flashed his lamp within.
   There she lay, a pitiful little figure, one bare arm flung over her face, while one step below her the tide of annihilation writhed and crawled.
   Too late to reach her. For perhaps one second his mind balked and his heart stopped beating. Let that dark horror but touch her for an instant and she was lost for ever.
   In that dreadful moment his mind turned instinctively to the only god he knew— the Lord of Darkness — and as the wordless prayer was uttered power surged through his body, hanging limp over the altar-side. This monstrosity which threatened the very soul of the girl he loved was his, bound to his family by ties centuries old; his to command.
   His lips parted and from them flowed the words of power— phrases he had not known he knew, rising from some forgotten ancestral memory. The very air throbbed as the mighty syllables crashed through it.
   The tide was stayed. Slowly, reluctantly, the loathsome thing sank back, step by step, quivering with baffled rage.
   Instantly Tony was over the altar-side, had gathered Valerie in his arms, and was back again in safety. He laid her gently down and lowered the altar-stone. As the catch clicked into place, so the tension which had upheld him during those awful moments was released, and he sank down beside the girl, trembling violently, and gripped by a dreadful nausea.
   When he had recovered somewhat he turned to the girl and gently raised her head. She opened her eyes, dark with terror, and looked up at him. His torch, still burning, lay near by, and she could see his troubled face plainly in the dim light. As she recognized him, so the horror in her eyes faded, and tears came in its stead. Her arms crept about his neck and he bent his head and kissed her gently on the lips. She clung to him, crying softly like a child that has been badly frightened and finds refuge in its mother’s arms.
   At last she grew quiet, and, holding his torch with difficulty, he picked her up and carried her back to the great hall. All was still— there seemed to be no one else awake in the building — so he took her to her own room and laid her on the bed. Then he fetched water and bathed her bruised hands.
   Neither spoke a word. The terrible experience she had undergone had all but broken Valerie’s spirit, and Tony, with deep understanding, refrained from uttering the questions which crowded to his lips.
   Day was breaking when he left her, kissing her gently on the brow, his reward a little smile so tender that, in spite of the gloomy circumstances, his heart burst into song within his breast. But as he made his way quietly to his own room the light died from his face and his brows drew together in a frown of dreadful fury, for he knew instinctively who was responsible for the night of terror which she had been through.
   Valerie did not appear at the breakfast-table, and Hamilton was the first to comment on her absence. As he did so Gaunt looked across at his colleague and their eyes met. In an even voice the doctor said:
   “Perhaps she is unwell.”
   Tony, who had scarcely spoken until then, answered him.
   “Yes,” said he, “she is having breakfast in her room, poor child. She had a ghastly experience last night.”
   “Why, Tony, what on earth do you mean?” Hamilton’s anxious query fell into the gulf of silence which had opened in their midst. Vaughan looked as if his collar were about to suffocate him, and Gaunt turned deadly pale, clenching his hands beneath the table until the nails drew blood.
   Tony went on, calmly:
   “She was apparently seized with a sudden and overwhelming desire to see for herself what was in the passages beneath the crypt altar.”
   “Good God!” Hamilton said in a shocked tone. “Do you mean to say she went down there by herself, in the dark?”
   “She took a lamp, John, but dropped it, apparently. Fortunately I woke, for some unaccountable reason, and went down to see if everything was all right. Finding the way to the crypt open, I investigated, and was, fortunately, just in time.”
   “In time for what, Tony?”
   “In time to save her from the curse.”
   “Good heavens! You don’t mean to tell me there really is something in the legend, then?”
   Tony sighed wearily.
   “I can’t hope to explain, John, if you don’t understand what I mean. Suffice it that she was nearly frightened out of her wits, in the same manner as my father was. If I had not arrived when I did she would be insane now, at the very least, if not literally dead from shock.”
   Hamilton sat silent, his face showing plainly the turmoil which was going on in his head. There was much he did not understand, much that he felt he ought to understand, but which, somehow, just eluded him.
   Vaughan, who by this time had recovered his voice, remarked suavely:
   “It might well have been a horrible tragedy, Sir Anthony. You know my views as to the nature of the curse. I wonder what can have possessed Miss Bennett to go down, after my warning.”
   Gaunt, taking his cue from the other, put in:
   “I don’t think you put it plainly enough, Vaughan. You spoke to her of purely physical dangers from falling rocks and so on. Miss Bennett probably did not appreciate the appalling spiritual dangers of the place. I am very glad you were in time, Tony.”
   Tony looked at his tutor so strangely that the doctor lowered his eyes and was silent. This was one of the very few occasions in his life upon which Gaunt did not feel master of the situation. As soon as he could he excused himself and withdrew, taking Vaughan with him.
   When they were gone, Hamilton spoke very gravely.
   “I can’t say ‘Thank you’, Tony,” he said. “This is the second time you have probably saved Valerie’s life. One doesn’t thank a person for saving one’s own life, and her life means more to me than that even.”
   He put out his hand, and Tony gripped it firmly, saying no less earnestly:
   “I know, John. You see, I love her too. Did you guess?”
   “I suspected as much. Well, we’re too old friends to quarrel over her. She must choose for herself. Good luck, old man.”
   “Thanks, John. Now look: we must get her away from here as soon as possible. After last night I dare not let her stay an hour longer than is absolutely necessary. The sea appears to be a little less rough today. It will be dangerous to attempt the crossing, but not, I think, so dangerous as to remain here. Are you game to risk it?”
   “Of course, if you think best. I’m afraid that even now I can’t realize the meaning of all this.”
   “You will one day.” There was a hint of sadness in Tony’s voice. “I’ve seen Valerie this morning and told her, so when she’s ready we’ll try to get across.”
   Less than an hour later Tony and Hamilton stood waiting in the kitchen, wearing oilskins. Hamilton still wore a vaguely puzzled expression, but the younger man’s face was a mask of grim determination.
   When Valerie joined them, her face pale and strained, looking ridiculously small in a macintosh belonging to Tony, Hamilton started towards her, saying:
   “Are you all right, Valerie? I can’t imagine — “
   But she cut him short with:
   “Please, John, not now. I’ll tell you all about it afterwards. I’m ready, Tony.”
   Hamilton fell back abashed and let Tony lead her out. Mrs. Lorrimer had followed Valerie downstairs and stood watching them, her kindly face lined with worry. Hamilton briefly bade her good-bye and followed the others.
   The launch was waiting at the landing-stage with her engine running. Lorrimer stood by and helped Valerie aboard. Tony followed her and sat down by Tregellis, who was at the wheel. As Hamilton came up the old servant said softly:
   “You still don’t remember, sir?”
   Receiving only a blank stare, he shook his head with a sigh and said:
   “Good-bye, sir, and a safe voyage.”
   Hamilton scrambled on board and sat down by Valerie in the stern. Tregellis threw the screw into gear, the water behind the boat began to boil, and they glided away, slowly at first, but with gathering speed as they passed through the narrow harbour mouth, from which the water-gate had now been removed. Hamilton looked back and saw Lorrimer, a forlorn figure, standing watching them go. Then they reached the open sea and the long struggle began.
   The wind had dropped to a stiff breeze, but it was raining heavily, and there was a strong sea running. Twice they were almost dashed against the rocks before they reached open water. Hamilton remembered vividly the last occasion upon which he and Valerie had been in a boat together, and he looked down at her. It was evident that the same thought was in her mind, for a small, cold hand crept into his, and he held it fast.
   The launch rolled horribly and shipped a good deal of water as it wallowed in the trough of the long rollers, but Tregellis knew his job, and made a long detour to the south to avoid the tide race between the island and the mainland. Perhaps three hours passed before they began to fight their way back towards Pentock.
   When at last they reached the quay they found the waterfront deserted and the boats beached. Even the fishermen had been forced to abandon their occupation by reason of the great storm.
   At the steps Hamilton jumped out and, turning, caught the girl as she followed. Tony remained in the launch. Hamilton exclaimed:
   “Aren’t you coming with us, Tony? The rector will be very pleased to see you, I know.”
   “No, John, thank you. I must get back to my friends. I have a bone to pick with them. Valerie will explain.”
   “Say good-bye to them for me,” replied Hamilton. “I quite forgot.”
   Tony made no reply, but told Tregellis to put about and make for Kestrel. Then he called across the widening space:
   “Don’t think too hardly of me, John. I’ve done my best.”
   “What does he mean?” Hamilton turned a puzzled face to Valerie, but she only caught his arm, saying:
   “Do hurry, John. We must get to the rectory before anyone sees us and rushes to tell Uncle we’re alive. His heart’s not too good, you know, and the shock might kill him. I’m terribly worried as it is.”
   He suffered her to lead him away, but still he kept looking back at the receding launch, with Tony’s figure sitting still and silent beside the helmsman, until it was out of sight behind the headland.
   Since their path did not lie through the village they met no one before reaching the rectory. The girl’s worry over her uncle had communicated itself to her companion by this time, and he was wondering desperately what he should say to the old man.
   The front door was unfastened and they walked in. There seemed to be no one about, so they went through into the kitchen, where they found Mrs. Drew, the housekeeper, washing crockery in the sink. She looked round as they entered, and for a moment it seemed as though she would faint, but she recovered herself and flung her wet arms round Valerie, crying:
   “Thank God, Miss Valerie, thank God! We thought you was drowned for sure.”
   Valerie calmed the good soul and asked her where the rector was.
   “In church, my dear. Where else should he be? He was nigh crazed at first, but now he does naught but pray.”
   “Come, John, we’ll go to him.”
   Hand in hand they went out into the dripping garden and through the churchyard.
   It was very dark in the little church, and at first they could not see the rector at all. Then they made out a slight figure kneeling among the shadows before the side altar upon which stood the Tabernacle. By a common impulse they quietly went up to him and knelt down, one on either side.
   So rapt in prayer was he that he was unaware of their presence for some minutes. At last he raised his grey head and looked first to the right and then to the left.
   Hamilton held his breath. Would this second shock be too much for him? But the serene face of the priest never altered, save that his mouth lost its rigid lines and softened into a gentle smile. Stretching out his arms, he put one round each of them and drew them close.
   “God has heard the prayers of an old man,” he whispered softly. “To Him be the glory! They told me there was no hope, but they were wrong.”* * *
   Back in the house once more, and sitting before a cheerful fire in the little study, Hamilton told their story, blaming himself bitterly for the original expedition which had ended so disastrously.
   When he had finished, the rector said:
   “I expect Valerie was as much to blame as you, John. I know her ways, bless her! But don’t talk of blame now. You have brought her safely back to me, and that’s all that matters. You were in God’s hands. When you didn’t come back to dinner I began to worry, thinking you were lost on the moors in the storm; but when they told me you had gone out in a dinghy we gave you up for lost. I must admit that it was one of the very few occasions upon which I have questioned the ways of the Almighty, but I got over that. I said a requiem for you this morning. I don’t suppose it did you any harm.”
   He chuckled softly, but there were tears in his eyes as he patted Valerie’s hand.
   “And now, my dear,” he said to her, “there is something sadly amiss with John’s story. I am very puzzled. Perhaps you can help me. He speaks of your dreadful adventure of last night as if he hardly believed it had happened at all. He never mentions the horror you must both have felt when you found yourself on that accursed island, with Anthony Lovell and his beastly friends. Can you explain this?”
   Hamilton sat there frowning. The priest’s words touched some lost chord in his mind, but he could not grasp it. It was as if a dense fog lay over part of his brain. He listened eagerly to Valerie’s words.
   “Yes, Uncle, I think I can help — a little,” said she. “I was like that too until this morning. It’s awfully hard to explain, but when I first woke up on Kestrel, after we were wrecked, I had no recollection whatever of anything you or John had told me about those two monsters who have got poor Tony in their power, or of the true nature of the secret order to which they all belong. I regarded Dr. Gaunt as an ordinary, kindly professional man, and his friend, Simon Vaughan, as a decent psychic investigator. I think John is still under the same delusion.”
   “Monstrous!” murmured the rector. “They undoubtedly worked upon your minds while you lay helpless and exhausted. John, do you mean to tell me you remember nothing of what we talked of so many times?”
   Hamilton knitted his brows.
   “I’ve been trying to remember,” he said hesitantly, “and now I do seem to recollect something very vague about it. But it all seems incredibly remote and fantastic. I can’t bring myself to believe in it at all now. Certainly it never crossed my mind while I was at the Abbey.”
   “Amazing! Tell me, Valerie, when did you remember?”
   “A few minutes after I dropped my lamp in the tunnel last night. At first I wasn’t a bit frightened — only worried lest I should be lost down there. Then, all at once, it came back to me. I realized where I was, and in whose power we were. It was as if a veil had suddenly dropped from my eyes. Then —it came!” She shuddered violently and stopped.
   The rector caught her hand.
   “Don’t think about that,” he commanded. “What happened afterwards — when you were safe?”
   Mastering her emotion with a struggle, she went on:
   “When I came round Tony was bending over me. As soon as I saw his poor face, so dreadfully distressed, I knew he wasn’t really one of them at heart. He told me everything this morning before we left. He believes that Dr. Gaunt deliberately made me go down into the caves to get rid of me. When he thought I was at the mercy of that horrible thing he must have released his control over my mind, and I remembered. That’s Tony’s explanation, anyhow.”
   “But why should Gaunt do such a thing,” asked Hamilton — “even supposing that it’s all true?”
   The girl blushed and lowered her eyes.
   “Tony said probably because Gaunt thought he was getting too interested in me. After that his one thought was to get me away as soon as possible. He wouldn’t let me see them again. I begged him to give up the whole thing, and come with us, but he said he was bound by the most frightful oaths, and couldn’t possibly. I feel dreadfully sorry for him.”
   “I wish he had come with you,” said the rector. “It is evident that he is not wholly with them, and I think I could make him change his mind, even now. His act in saving you must have weakened their hold over him a good deal. I only hope it won’t make it any harder for him.”
   Hamilton laughed suddenly, making them both stare at him.
   “I think you’re both taking it far too seriously,” he said. “It’s all nonsense, anyway. Such things don’t happen nowadays, if they ever did, which I very much doubt. If poor old Tony has gone potty, cooped up there with those two charlatans, there is no reason why we should.”
   “John,” said the rector gravely, “I wish you would make an effort to overcome this state of mind you are in. It’s going to be a great source of weakness to us if you don’t.”
   “I don’t see why I should come back to your point of view at all,” Hamilton returned. “It only seems to make you miserable. Life’s too short for tears.”
   “Jesus wept,” the rector reminded him.
   Hamilton laughed again, this time so rudely that Valerie jumped up with a little cry.
   “John! Don’t be a beast!” — and, bursting into tears, she fled from the room.
   “Excuse me a moment,” said the rector, and followed her.
   He found her in her bedroom, her face buried in the pillow, sobbing bitterly. He touched her quivering shoulder, and when she had quieted, he said:
   “Valerie, my dear, this won’t do. I know you have been grievously tried today, but you mustn’t give way now. John can’t help himself; I rather fancy they’re working on him now. That damnable link between his mind and Gaunt’s must be broken, and you’ve got to help me. Do you understand?”
   She lifted her tear-stained face and nodded.
   “I’ll try, Uncle. But it hurts to see him like that.”
   “Yes, my dear, I know; but be brave. Shall we go down now? I’m going to try and get him into church.”
   Downstairs Hamilton was sitting as they had left him. He felt vaguely sorry for having upset Valerie, but uppermost in his mind was a profound feeling of contempt for the rector’s foolish beliefs. He looked up at the crucifix on the wall and it was all he could do to keep himself from laughing aloud. That absurd little image! What good did they imagine it did? Idolatry! The word rose to the surface of his mind like a bubble of gas in a stagnant pond. They worshiped thatpainted doll, these foolish, wicked people. He became filled with righteous indignation, and, rising, unhooked the thing. As soon as it was in his hands a fierce hatred boiled in his veins, and he flung it into the fire with an exclamation of disgust.
   At that moment the door opened and the rector came in. Taking in the situation at a glance, he stood still, blocking the door, so that Valerie, behind him, should not see the blazing crucifix.
   “Nice work, John!” he say gaily. “Why not come into the church? We’ve lots more in there you can pull down, you know.”
   Hamilton stared at him. Was this stupid old fool laughing at him? No, he decided, he was not. For a moment he toyed with the idea of accepting the invitation, but a voice within him peremptorily forbade it. Muttering an apology, he pushed past them both, walked quickly to the front door, and out of the house.
   “After him, Valerie,” the rector ordered. “Don’t let him get away. Bring him into church somehow. His soul is at stake.”
   Gathering up the skirts of his cassock, the old man fairly ran out of the back door towards the church.
   The girl stood still, trembling all over. Then she plucked up her courage and followed Hamilton.
   He had only got as far as the lane when she overtook him. Slipping her arm through his, she snuggled against him. He stopped.
   What did she want? He stared down at her vaguely. He had thought he loved her once. Silly little fool!
   Then she turned her head, and her glorious eyes looked full into his. He felt himself slipping, drowning in their grey depths. Her red mouth curved invitingly. A great wave of desire swept over him, and he caught her in his arms, kissing her hungrily. He could feel her sweet, small breasts crushed against him.
   Meekly she submitted, and when he let her go, breathing heavily and trembling with passion, she caught him by the hand.
   “Come with me, John,” she breathed.
   Dumbly he let her lead him back, through the churchyard.
   At the door of the church he hesitated, but she looked back at him, and seeing nothing but her lovely face, he stumbled in after her. Like a flash she swung the heavy door shut, turned the key, and flung it far up the church.
   As it tinkled on the floor a blind rage swept through him. Thought they’d trapped him, did they? He’d show them! Turning, he began to batter at the unyielding door, even as Valerie had beaten at the altar-stone on Kestrel not so long before.
   All at once the darkness of his fury was pierced by the liquid tinkle of a bell. He swung round, caught his breath in a great sob, and fell back against the wall.
   The High Altar was ablaze with light, and in the midst of the golden glow stood the rector, clad in his sacerdotal vestments, the shimmering humeral veil about his shoulders swathing those consecrated hands which held aloft the glittering monstrance, rayed like the sun in splendour, with the white round of the Host gleaming at its heart.
   The moment his eyes fell upon the holy thing Hamilton felt a sharp pang of agony, like the thrust of a flaming sword, run through his whole being, and when the priest made the sign of the cross with It he uttered one shrill cry of anguish and fell headlong to the floor.
   When he opened his eyes again the rector and Valerie were kneeling beside him, and the girl’s face was wet with tears.
   “Don’t cry, Val darling,” he said weakly, “we’re safe now. Did the dinghy sink?”
   Chapter XVI
   I
   Nicholas Gaunt stood at one of the narrow windows of the tower room watching the retreating launch. When it was hidden by the mist of rain he turned to his companion, who sat near by, smoking his eternal cheroot.
   “Well?” he queried.
   “He suspects, I think,” said Vaughan.
   “Worse — he knows. I did not anticipate failure when I let her remember. She will have told him everything. It is significant that he has taken her away without letting her see us again. He will be difficult.”
   “If he returns.” Vaughan’s tone was gloomy.
   “He will return. He knows the penalty for desertion. You had better leave this to me, Simon.”
   “With the greatest pleasure in the world, Doctor.”
   So it was that when Tony came back from Pentock he found only the doctor awaiting him, standing with his back to the fire in the great hall, his hands behind him, spread out to the blaze, and a cigarette drooping carelessly from the corner of his mouth.
   Tony waited until Lorrimer had taken away his dripping oilskin and then, white with rage, he approached the doctor and faced him.
   “Damn you, Gaunt!” he burst out.
   The other raised a deprecating hand.
   “One moment, Tony,” he said quietly. “You are angry, and justly so. I should not have taken such a step without first consulting you. Please forgive me; I acted for your best interests.”
   The young man stared at him in frank astonishment.
   “You admit it, then? You admit your responsibility for what happened last night?”
   “The responsibility was yours, not mine, Tony. If you had not permitted yourself to become infatuated with this girl I should not have been compelled to act as I did.”
   “To hell with that for a tale! I’ve been fooled by you and your precious friend Vaughan long enough. This time you have gone too far. You can’t bluff your way out of this. Valerie has opened my eyes.”
   “Blinded them, I think, Tony, to the eternal values which once you thought so important.”
   “Blast you and your eternal values! I know of nothing more valuable to me than the life of the girl I love. You tried to take her from me last night and failed, fortunately for you. If you had succeeded I should have killed you with my bare hands.”
   Gaunt smiled gently.
   “How melodramatic! I would not advise you ever to try anything so foolish. Lay but a hand upon me and it would be you who would die, not me.”
   “I’m not at all sure that I believe that now. Anyhow, it doesn’t matter. I’m through. You and Vaughan can pack your bags and clear out just as soon as you please.”
   Controlling himself with a great effort, Tony turned away and went towards the staircase. Consequently he did not see the demoniacal rage which blazed for a moment from the doctor’s eyes. Gaunt’s voice was still calm and perfectly modulated when he spoke.
   “One moment, Tony. Would you cast out your proved friends for this girl of whom you know nothing? Does she love you, even?”
   Tony said not a word, but began to mount the staircase.
   Again the doctor spoke.
   “You poor deluded fool! Destroy yourself then in your own folly. At this very moment she is in Hamilton’s arms, laughing at you.”
   Tony stopped and slowly turned his head.
   “That’s not true,” said he.
   Gaunt laughed sarcastically.
   “You think it possible, then?” he sneered. “Oh, what a trusting lover have we here! How little you know of women and their ways! They are all whores, and Valerie Bennett is no better than the rest.”
   Tony stood very still, going white to the lips. Then he came slowly down the stairs again and approached the doctor, who was coolly lighting another cigarette. He looked up as the young man approached and his lips twisted sardonically. The other stopped a few feet away and said very quietly:
   “Take that back, please, Dr. Gaunt.”
   The doctor laughed softly to himself and blew out a cloud of smoke, watching it as it curled upwards to the roof.
   “I’ll give you one more chance, Gaunt. Take back what you said about Valerie and I’ll forget it.” Tony’s voice was hardly above a whisper, but he was shaking like a leaf with the fury of his passion. The doctor never moved, but only smiled the more.
   “Very well. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” As the young man raised his hand to strike the pale, sneering face, so the doctor’s narrowed eyes opened wide, blazing with a cold grey light. Tony felt as if he himself had been struck a violent blow, and reeled back, his hand falling helplessly to his side. For a moment he stood, his face puckering strangely, then he flung himself down upon the near-by settee and burst into a torrent of sobs.
   He felt a gentle touch upon his bowed head, and looking up found the doctor bending over him, an expression of tender compassion upon his face.
   Tony gulped.“I raised my hand against you master,” he whispered. “Can you ever forgive me?”
   “It is forgiven already, my son. Forgive me, too, if I spoke harshly, but I had to break the spell she had cast over you.”
   “It’s true, then, what you said?”
   “Only too true, I fear. I spoke from knowledge, not at random. Come, I will show you.”
   “No, no! I don’t want to see. I believe you.”
   “You must. I cannot have you weakened like this. Come!”
   The doctor’s old ascendancy conquered, and Tony followed him up to his room. There Gaunt took out his crystal and set it upon the table, motioning Tony to look into it.
   “Look, my son,” said he, “and behold the frailty that is woman. I will not influence you at all. There is no deceit.”
   He walked over to the window and stood looking out, while Tony gazed into the shadowy depths of the crystal, stretching his mind out towards Valerie. All at once he stiffened and his breath came faster.
   What he saw need not be recorded. Suffice it that not many yards away Vaughan was sitting with the duplicate crystal, exercising his trained will to the uttermost, and projecting into the two co-ordinated spheres a vision which was wholly false, born in the dark recesses of his own obscene brain.
   After a few minutes Tony sprang up, his cheeks stained a dull red and his mouth twisted with pain.
   “No more!” he gasped. “I have seen enough. Oh, Valerie! And Hamilton — the filthy swine!”
   Gaunt regarded him with quiet satisfaction.
   “Be of good heart, my son,” said he. “Our great faith rises above such little things. You can have her, too, you know, provided you do not let her dominate your soul.”
   “No! Not after that. I couldn’t touch her.” Angrily Tony dashed the tears from his eyes.
   “Then, Tony,” pursued the doctor, “there only remains — vengeance!”
   “How?”
   “We will say the Black Mass with special intention for their destruction.”
   “When?” Tony passed his tongue over his dry lips.
   “Tonight. Afterwards their lives will not be worth the living.” He caught Tony’s shoulders in a firm grip. “All power is given unto us. Those two shall rue the day they offended you, my brother.”
   Tony’s lip twisted into a snarl.
   “They shall,” he muttered.
   “Go to your room, then, my son, and pray to our Lord that He will look favourably upon our sacrifice. When all is ready I will summon you.”
   When the young man had gone Vaughan rejoined his colleague.
   “Did I do well?” he inquired.
   “Far better than I had hoped. You were in great form tonight, Simon. He was very difficult at first, but now he thinks only of revenge. You shall say the Mass tonight and he will help you.”
   “Magnificent! In the meantime… Hamilton?”
   “Yes, I had thought of that. We will endeavour to put a spoke in the wheel of our friend the Reverend Father Bennett.” Gaunt chuckled. “Come, let us see what is really happening there.”
   They sat down at the crystal and were almost immediately watching the scene in the rector’s study, where Hamilton was relating his version of the visit to the Abbey.
   For a long time they sat thus, the doctor occasionally moving his lips silently. Suddenly his face changed, and Vaughan looked up, about to speak, but was silenced by a gesture. The mocking smile had disappeared from Gaunt’s lips and his eyes were wide. His companion could feel the energy pouring from that rigid form into the crystal. A strange hush came over the room and the pale light within the sphere grew stronger. The tension increased until Vaughan felt that he could bear it no longer — that he must screamor die. A faint groan came from Gaunt’s lips, and the sweat glistened on his brow.
   Then, with a splintering crash, the quivering crystal burst into a thousand fragments, and Gaunt sprang up, his chair going over behind him. He stood trembling with rage, and taking out his handkerchief began to dab his cheek, where the blood was welling from a gash inflicted by one of the slivers of flying glass.
   The other sat huddled up, his face grey with terror and his great body trembling like a leaf.
   “That damned girl again,” said the doctor in a thick voice; “but for her he would not have gone in.”
   “They are moving against us,” whimpered Vaughan.
   “Yes, and we must move faster. Tonight will see the beginning of the end.”
   “Why not the end itself?” Vaughan urged. “Why must we wait until the twenty-fifth? I know you have told Tony that it is because that day is the anniversary of the Abbot’s curse, but what has that to do with it, when the monstrosity was here long before then?”
   “Because that day is not only the anniversary of the Abbot’s curse, but also, by what at first seems a strange coincidence, the anniversary of the day, centuries before, when the Veil was rent, and the monstrosity first came into the world. It is really no coincidence, for these matters are governed by laws which even I do not fully understand, but I do know, for certain weighty cosmic reasons which I cannot explain to you, Simon, that upon that day only, at twelve noon, can the monstrosity be released from this rock and loosed upon the world. It can be released from its bondage to the Lovells at any time, and that is what Tony will do, all unknowingly, tonight.”* * *
   Shortly after midnight the three met again in the crypt. Tony’s temporary rebellion against his old allegiance had left him more devoted to the occult faith than ever before, and he was determined to make amends for his lapse. His blind rage of the afternoon had been replaced by a grim resolve to have his revenge upon the girl who he believed had been responsible for his infidelity, and who had been proved so unworthy.
   He vested rapidly, eager to begin the ceremony which he knew would effect his purpose; at once testifying to his renewed enthusiasm and bringing disaster upon the heads of the unhappy pair who had wronged him. When he had finished he began to prepare the incense, lighting the necessary charcoal and putting it into the thurible. In the absence of servers he, as subdeacon, would have to act as thurifer, in addition to his other duties.
   While Tony was thus engaged Vaughan and Gaunt put on their own vestments in silence. The former wore the customary chasuble of the celebrant, and the latter the deacon’s dalmatic. Their attire was identical with that of the sacred ministers at a Catholic High Mass, and the vestments had, indeed, been used for that purpose at one time, before they were degraded to their present office.
   The altar had been draped with a dark cloth and bore six tall candles of black wax, which burnt with a smoky, bluish flame. In the centre stood an inverted crucifix with a serpent coiled about the Figure. One of Vaughan’s trunks served for a credence table, upon which stood chalice and paten, and the cruets of wine and water. The dim light of the candles was reinforced by two lamps set on the floor.
   When all was ready the three took up their positions on the altar steps, and the dreadful mockery began. Thick yellow clouds of pungent incense-smoke billowed up against the low roof.
   Until the consecration the ritual tallied with normal Catholic procedure, save that the prayers were invariably twisted into blasphemous contradiction, the great voice of the apostate priest echoing round the distant walls as he intoned them.
   What must Vaughan’s thoughts be? Tony wondered, as he watched him bending over the altar, the blue glimmer of the candles shining on his hairless skull. Did he remember the countless times he had performed this self-same act, with how different an intention, before he had joined the legions of Darkness? But Tony had never been a Catholic, and the peculiarly monstrous nature of the contradiction did not occur to him. He was disposed to look upon all sacramental ceremony as somewhat childish and absurd, and did his part automatically, as he had been taught, with little thought for the deep significance of hisactions.
   “Hoc est enim corpus meum…” the most awful words that the lips of man can utter. Tony heard them, scarcely realizing the tremendous miracle which was taking place; for, whatever his crimes, Vaughan’s priestly power was indestructible.
   “Hic est enim calix sanguinis mei —.”
   The Sacred Body and the Precious Blood were on the altar. Vaughan did not genuflect, but made an obscene gesture, then turned and beckoned Tony. The young man approached, took the Chalice from the priest, and deliberately poured its Contents upon the altar steps. The Blood splashed as it fell, spattering the white skirt of his alb with the red drops of guilt. He flung the empty vessel from him, and as it rang upon the stone floor the echoes of its fall were caught and flung backwards and forwards under the vaulted roof until it seemed as if a legion of fiends was gathered in the shadows, laughing, laughing…
   The brief clamour died away and a strange hush followed, as if all creation were watching the sacrilege with bated breath. For a moment that seemed as long as eternity the three stood motionless, their gorgeous vestments shimmering in the dim light.
   Gaunt was the first to move, and he too mounted the altar steps, drawing from his girdle a small dagger of peculiar design, which he handed to Tony. As his fingers closed round the cold metal hilt a sudden pang shot up the young man’s arm and he all but dropped the thing. Recovering himself, he faced the altar once more and raised the dagger aloft. The candlelight glittered evilly along the triangular blade. The watching shadows crowded closer upon the circle of light about the altar. The hush deepened until the silence seemed to press in upon them like a palpable thing. Tony’s eyes were fixed upon the Host, which lay before him startlingly white against the dark cloth. Yet again a thrill of anguish ran through his veins like fire, but, clenching his teeth, he brought the dagger sharply down, transfixing the gleaming disk which was the Heart of God. His own heart turned to ice as he saw the crimson stain spreading from the wound, but, swept away on the wings of ritual, he lifted the holy Thing and cast It to the ground, grinding It with his heel into the dust.
   Instantly the silence was broken by an appalling tumult of sound, such as Tony had heard once before, on the night his father died. Now it was infinitely louder and more near— beneath his very feet. At the same moment the solid rock began to heave like the restless sea which surrounded it.
   All three were flung to the ground, and lay where they fell, stunned by the din. The great stone top of the altar was forced violently upwards, scattering the candles in all directions. And a mighty wind came roaring up out of the depths, extinguishing the lamps and whirling round the crypt like a hurricane.
   Gaunt alone kept command of his senses during those awful moments. As soon as he was able he began to crawl across the reeling floor, the wind plucking at his robes, one hand outstretched, searching for Tony in the darkness. At last he found him, and putting his lips close to the young man’s ear he shouted at the top of this voice:
   “Quickly! Make an act of renunciation of your power over this thing. You can no longer control it. I can. Quickly, our lives depend upon it.”
   Painfully Tony gathered his scattered wits together, and, realizing the urgency of the doctor’s appeal, strove to concentrate all his energies upon the matter. Locking his hands in Gaunt’s, he focused his will upon the other, and as their minds vibrated in unison he uttered the words with his whole being:
   “Whatsoever power I have over this monstrosity I renounce, and yield it utterly to thee.”
   The thick darkness hid the dreadful grin of triumph on the doctor’s face as he staggered to his feet, crying:
   “Be still, thou creature of the Outer Darkness, be still! Thy master commands!”
   Immediately the bellowing ceased and the wind died away.
   The quivering of the rock continued for a while, but soon even that was stilled.
   II
   Tony came down to breakfast in a thoughtful mood. He had had no further conversation with the doctor since the celebration of the Black Mass, for, when they had relit the lamps and secured the altar-stone once more, all three had retired to bed at once, utterly exhausted by the terrible experience they had undergone. Tony had fallen into a heavy, dreamless sleep the moment his head touched the pillow, and when he woke the sun was high over the sea.
   His rage of yesterday against Valerie and Hamilton for the supposed wrong they had done him was spent. He scarcely thought of them, but racked his brains continually to discover what Gaunt’s purpose had been in persuading him to assist at the fantastic ceremony in the crypt. He told himself that the doctor must have known what would happen; how the curse, its strength multiplied a thousandfold, would become uncontrollable by him. It would seem that the difficulties of banishing itfrom the island were now almost insuperable, though the bonds which had bound the horror to himself were, apparently, broken. Badly wanting Gaunt’s opinion on the matter, he hurried down the great staircase and along the corridor to the dining-hall.
   To his surprise, the table was not laid, and the ashes of yesterday’s fire still littered the hearth. He glanced at his watch, saw that it was after ten, and, frowning slightly, made his way to the kitchen.
   There was no sign of the Lorrimers, and no fire burnt in the great kitchen range. On the table, however, was an envelope addressed to himself. He tore it open and quickly read the brief note within:
   Sir Anthony,
   We are more sorry than we can say to leave you like this, but my wife and I are agreed that we can stay no longer in this place. Not after last night, sir. We shall be only too pleased to serve you in London, or anywhere else, sir, but not here any more.

   Your obt. servant,
   James Lorrimer

   P.S. Tom will bring the boat back, sir.
   Biting his lips, Tony crushed the letter into a ball, threw it into the grate, and returned to the great hall, where he flung himself into a chair and lit a cigarette.
   He had not been there long before he heard voices in the gallery above, and, looking up, saw Dr. Gaunt and his portly colleague descending the staircase.
   He was immediately struck by the contrast in their demeanours. Vaughan’s flabby face seemed to have fallen in; there were shadows under his little eyes and his lips were grey. He dragged his feet on the stairs. Gaunt, on the other hand, looked jubilant, in spite of the sticking-plaster on his cheek. His eyes shone like twin stars and his lips twitched with excitement. He fairly tripped down the stairs, leaving his companion far behind, and, as he approached, Tony could feel the atmosphere of power which radiated from his body.
   “Good morrow, Tony!” he cried, with a cheerful smile. “Did you sleep well?”
   “Very well, thank you, Doctor,” answered Tony. “But I’ve got some bad news for you, I’m afraid.”
   Gaunt raised an eyebrow, and Tony went on:
   “The Lorrimers have cleared off and left us in the lurch. They left a note for me. It seems that they were frightened out of their wits last night.”
   “I don’t blame them,” said the doctor with a laugh. “Don’t worry, my boy, we shall be able to fend for ourselves for a while. It won’t be long now, eh, Vaughan?”
   The other, who had now joined them, merely grunted, looking at the floor, and rubbing his hands nervously together.
   “You mean we shall be able to get rid of the curse soon, then, Doctor?” Tony asked eagerly.
   “Yes, we shall be rid of it.” Gaunt smiled crookedly. “We shall free it from this island, even as it was freed from you last night. It is in my hands now.”
   Tony frowned, puzzled by the doctor’s apparent reversal of the pronouns. Surely he had been freed from the curse, not the curse from him? He let the question pass, and asked another:
   “It’s been worrying me ever since I woke, Doctor. I can’t understand why you permitted last night’s ceremony at all. Isn’t the curse much more powerful now?”
   “The curse, as you persist in terming it, is the most tremendous evil force this world has ever known. I should remind you that it is actually a monstrosity of the Outer Darkness, an intruder from the chaos which exists behind the Veil of dimensional matter, and that its power is incalculable.”
   “But won’t it be even more difficult to banish now, Doctor?” Tony was very puzzled.
   “Who spoke of banishment? I doubt if it could be banished. But it will be a simple matter torelease it.”
   Vaughan coughed and took a step forward, but Gaunt raised his hand.
   “No, Simon, it is right that he should know. He is one of us now, and will rejoice with us when he knows what he has done.”
   “What do you mean?” A dreadful suspicion was forming in Tony’s mind, and he waited breathlessly for Gaunt’s reply.
   “I mean that I have no intention whatever of even attempting to send this thing back whence it came. I propose to loose it upon the world. It will do more for the ultimate triumph of our Lord than we have been able to achieve since the world began.”
   Keeping his voice steady by a great effort, Tony asked:
   “And I, what have I done?”
   “By assisting at the Mass and committing the final sacrilege you have set the seal upon your renunciation of all that is good, and thus made it impossible for the powers of light to assist you to control this monstrosity, even if you had wished. Furthermore, by reason of the subtle link which theAbbot’s words forged between your family and it, it shared in your violation of the Host, the focus of Light in this world, and it awoke once more to knowledge and dire hatred of its adversary. The same thing happened in the time of your ancestor, James Lovell, but you were more fortunate than he, who, unable to control it, was destroyed by it. You were able to sever the connection and pass the reins to me, who, by reason of my greater knowledge, could check its fury.”
   Tony’s head was bowed. When he spoke again his voice was hardly above a whisper.
   “What will happen when you release it?”
   A far-away look came into the doctor’s eyes, and his voice rang out like a trumpet:
   “It will spread in a thinning cloud over the whole earth, and mankind will turn its face from God and sink into the darkness of the Pit. There will be ceaseless wars and revolutions until civilization is lost in anarchy. Every spark of goodwill in the heart of man will be utterly quenched; and hewill at last lose his semblance of divinity, his immortal soul, and revert to the level of the beasts. Evolution will be reversed!”
   Tony stared incredulously at the pale face before him, lit with the fire of prophecy. Was this the teacher he had known and loved? The doctor’s face lost its prophetic fire, and he looked full into the eyes of the young man, his lean, handsome features twisting into a satanic smile. Tony groaned aloud.
   “I cannot — I will not permit it!” he gasped.
   “So!” Gaunt’s voice sank into a snarl. “Is this the stuff you are made of, Anthony Lovell? I always feared you were not worthy of our great brotherhood. Do you shrink from the triumph of our Lord like a girl from the sight of blood?”
   “No — no! I wanted His Kingdom to come upon earth — I want it still, but not like this! I desired knowledge, power, a god to worship; you gave them to me. I wanted to pass on my wonderful discovery to all men, to release them from the crushing bondage of the Nazarene, and the Church he left behind when we found him out and destroyed him. I wanted to see mankind rise glorious and proud; strong in the ancient wisdom; casting off the yoke of the Crucified; not blasted for ever.”
   “Words — words!” Gaunt broke in. “How little you know of us! Do you not understand that this world is itself a creation of the Power which we defy? It must all perish before we conquer. But that is your weakness, Anthony Lovell; inconsistency. All you want of religion is hope and faith, prayer and praise; you cannot face the ultimate. You were never one of them because you never believed their faith was real. You could not envisage the logical outcome of their beliefs — the winning of the world for Christ.” He spat viciously. “And now you cannot be one of us because you dare notface the consummation of our faith, the winning of the world for Satan.”
   He turned away, for Tony stood speechless, gazing at the ground. His self-created world was crashing about his ears; he felt utterly desolate, friendless, and alone. Gaunt turned again.
   “One last chance I will give you, Tony, because I have loved you well. Be with us, help us in this great blow we are about to strike for our Lord, and share with us the sweet fruits of victory. We shall not be forgotten when He comes into His Kingdom.”
   Tony shook his head.
   “Not that way!” he said in a choked voice.
   Gaunt shrugged his shoulders.
   “I pity you most profoundly,” said he; “outcast from both worlds you stand, helpless because you dare not face the truth. Come, Simon; let us leave the fool to his folly.”
   Vaughan looked up sharply. During the whole of the argument he had remained motionless, his head downcast, his fingers twisted together. Now Tony saw that upon his face there was an expression he could not analyze: there was sullen defiance in it, veiled sympathy, and a great horror.
   Their eyes met; the apostate priest, foul, degraded, the marks of his sins showing plainly in his countenance, and the young man whose faith had failed him; and over that vast gulf which yawned between them flashed the divine spark of sympathy. Brothers in adversity, their glances locked and held.
   Vaughan opened his lips to speak. What he would have said must remain for ever a mystery, for a remembered voice cut sharply into their midst:
   “Keep perfectly still, all of you, please!”
   In the entrance to the corridor beyond the staircase stood John Hamilton, pistol in hand; and behind him loomed the bulky form of Tom Tregellis.
   Chapter XVII
   John Hamilton was eating a hearty breakfast in the back parlour of the Three Fishermen when the landlord’s round red face appeared at the door.
   “There’s a lady and gentleman to see you, sir,” said he. “I think they’re from Kestrel.”
   “Bring them in.” Hamilton rose to his feet.
   “They won’t come, sir. Say they’ve got a train to catch.”
   “Right. I’ll come out.” Hamilton dropped his napkin on the table and went through the bar into the street.
   There he found a market cart, laden with luggage, and Mrs. Lorrimer perched insecurely on top. Her husband stood on the narrow pavement nervously fingering his hard black hat.
   “Good morning!” Hamilton greeted them. “You wished to see me?”
   “Yes, sir,” Lorrimer answered hesitantly. “We’re leaving.”
   “So I see. Have things got too much for you at last?”
   “That they have — but — are you all right now, sir?”
   “Why, what do you mean?”
   “Well, sir, last time I spoke to you about — about Sir Anthony and his friends, you didn’t seem to remember that we’d talked of it before.”
   “That would be when Miss Bennett and I were wrecked on Kestrel?”
   “Yes, sir.”
   “I hope I didn’t say anything offensive, Lorrimer. I’m afraid I was not quite myself. It seems that Dr. Gaunt somehow made me forget everything I knew to his discredit then. Since I got back I have remembered it all — how I came over when they were away and talked with you, and how we went down into the crypt. I had forgotten all that.”
   “There, you see, James,” Mrs. Lorrimer interjected, “I told you Mr. Hamilton didn’t know what he was doing.”
   “I was offensive, then — I’m terribly sorry,” said Hamilton quickly.
   “That’s all right, sir, now that we know what it was. It just shows how those devils can work on a man. It makes it easier to understand how they got Sir Anthony. Perhaps we shouldn’t have left him, after all, my dear.” He looked up at his wife doubtfully.
   “We couldn’t have stayed,” she replied firmly, “not after last night. Tell Mr. Hamilton.”
   Lorrimer looked about cautiously, and, seeing no one within earshot, told his tale in a low voice.
   “Last night it came again, sir, that awful noise we’ve heard twice before, only this time worse than it’s ever been. The whole place was shaking, fit to bring it down, sir. We thought it was the end — honest we did. And after it had stopped the feeling that came over us! Horrible it was. Like you felt in the crypt, sir; and up in our own room where it had never come before. And the wicked thoughts that came with it, too! It seemed as if nothing was worth while any more, sir. We couldn’t even pray. So we knew then that it was time for us to go.”
   “I don’t blame you in the least. Does Sir Anthony know you’ve left?”
   “I was coming to that, sir. That’s another thing. I’m no coward, as you’ll bear me out, sir, having been down in that crypt with me; and when it was light again, and I felt a bit more like myself, I went to Sir Anthony’s room to tell him we was going. I wouldn’t do a think like that behind his back. Well, I knocked, sir, but he was so sound asleep that I couldn’t wake him, so I went in. And the first thing I saw was a kind of white robe on the floor, where he’d dropped it before going to bed. And believe me, sir” — Lorrimer’s voice sank to a whisper — “there was blood on it, as sure as I’m standing here.”
   Hamilton stiffened, and a cold shudder went down his spine, despite the warm sun.
   “Blood! Are you sure, man, are you sure?” He gripped the other’s arm.
   “I wouldn’t take my oath on it, sir, but it looked like blood; I didn’t stay to make sure. I just couldn’t bring myself to touch him, for all that he lay sleeping like an innocent babe. There’s blood on his gown, I said to myself, and blood on his hands, most like. So I ran down those stairs faster than I came up; and we just left a note saying we’d gone.”
   Hamilton relaxed. A thought had struck him.
   “Did you notice anything else in Sir Anthony’s room?” he asked. “Any smell, for instance? And any other clothes laying about?”
   Lorrimer scratched his head.
   “Yes, sir,” he said at last, “now you come to mention it; there was that same smell I told you I noticed about the other two’s clothes; incense, they call it, don’t they, sir?”
   Hamilton nodded.
   “Yes, incense. And anything else besides the white robe?”
   “I didn’t stay long, as I’ve told you, sir. I thought to myself, ‘There’s been murder done last night; this is no place for us.’ But I do seem to recollect something else on the floor along with the robe; an embroidered sort of thing, red and gold, like one of those fancy waistcoats thegentry used to wear. But I only caught a glimpse; I couldn’t swear to the shape.”
   “That’s good enough.” Hamilton almost choked with relief. “For a moment I thought — but no, it wasn’t blood, Lorrimer; there’s been no murder done. Something far worse than mortal murder, in one respect, but something that is not altogether irreparable.” He saw the lack of comprehension in the other’s eyes, and explained briefly:
   “Those splashes were not blood, but wine: consecrated wine, I’m afraid, used at one of their abominable ceremonies.” He knew that the sturdy Nonconformist would not understand the sacrilege, and left it at that.
   Relief showed plainly in the faces of both Lorrimer and his wife.
   “Thank God for that!” said the old man. “I couldn’t believe my eyes — thank you, sir.” He was almost overcome with emotion.
   “What are your plans?” Hamilton asked.
   “We’re going to London, sir,” Mrs. Lorrimer explained. “I’ve got a sister there we can stay with until we can get another job.”
   “Good. Send me your address, and I’ll let you know how things go on. Did Tregellis bring you across?”
   “Yes, sir. He’ll take the boat back, and leave it there. They’ve plenty of tinned stuff and the likes of that. He doesn’t say much, but I know he feels as we do.”
   “Is he still in the harbour?”
   “Yes, sir, he’s waiting for a friend of his with a dinghy he can borrow to come back in.”
   “Splendid. Well, good-bye and good luck. You’ve been bricks, both of you.”
   “Good-bye, sir. What are you going to do, if I may make so bold as to ask?”
   “I’m going across with Tom to fetch Sir Anthony back; by force, if necessary.”
   Lorrimer’s face slowly whitened.
   “Oh, be careful, sir, for God’s sake!” said he. “There’s more on that island than three. If you ask me, I’d say their name was legion.”
   “I’ll be careful. Good-bye!”
   “Good-bye, and God bless you, sir!”
   Lorrimer climbed up beside his wife, gathered the reins together, and they drove slowly away up the hill. Hamilton turned on his heel, went quickly into the inn, and up to his room.
   Unlocking his suitcase, he took out the automatic pistol which Lorrimer had given him, slipped it into his pocket, and went out of the house.
   Down by the harbour he found Tom Tregellis sitting on an upturned boat thoughtfully chewing tobacco. He looked curiously at Hamilton and nodded.
   “Tregellis” — Hamilton’s voice was crisp and determined — “I’m going over there to bring Sir Anthony back, by hook or by crook. He’s in great danger. Will you help me?”
   The other went on chewing silently for a moment, then rose, spat adroitly over the wall into the sea, and rubbed his hands on his corduroy trousers.
   “Ay, sir, I’m with you,” he growled, and, without more ado, went down the steps and clambered into the launch moored there. Hamilton joined him; he started the engine and in less than five minutes they were in the open sea.
   Though the sun shone brightly, a strong breeze was still blowing, and the water was choppy. Hamilton sat watching the approaching island, wondering whether he should have consulted the rector before undertaking this rather desperate mission. He decided that Valerie would only have been worried on his account had she known, and concluded that he had taken the best course in the circumstances. He slipped his hand into his pocket and caressed the smooth steel of the pistol. Let anybody try any funny business this time, and they would find they had taken on more than they bargained for!
   The launch nosed its way into the narrow harbour and scraped along the landing-stage. Hamilton jumped out, caught the painter which Tregellis threw him, and made it fast. The latter shut off his engine and followed.
   Hamilton remarked:
   “We may have to use force. Don’t be surprised at whatever happens, but just follow my lead and we’ll soon have Sir Anthony in safety, or I’ll know the reason why.”
   Tregellis contented himself with a grunt in reply, but he spat on his hands, and, bending down, drew a short iron mooring-bar from its socket in the rock. Swinging it in his right hand, he followed Hamilton up the long stairway.
   They reached the courtyard round the Abbey without meeting anyone, and made their way to the back of the building. Here they found an unfastened door and entered the kitchens.
   As soon as they were inside Hamilton became aware of the intense atmosphere of evil which lay like a blight upon the place. It was almost identical with that which he had felt in the crypt, but instead of fluctuating, coming and going in waves as it had done then, it now remained constant, fixed, like the menace of a loaded gun. Overcoming the deep horror which began welling up in his heart, Hamilton went on towards the corridor which led to the hall.
   It was evident that Tregellis had noticed something too, for he wriggled his great shoulders and glanced round uneasily. Then he turned up his collar, spat again on his hands, and, gripping his iron club, followed Hamilton.
   They marched boldly along the passage and emerged into the great hall. Over against the fireplace Tony stood facing Vaughan and Gaunt. None of them was speaking, but they appeared to be quite unaware of the intrusion, until Hamilton, drawing his pistol, announced his presence with the command:
   “Keep perfectly still, all of you, please!”
   Three pairs of astonished eyes turned towards him. There was an electric pause, then:
   “Ah, the ubiquitous Mr. Hamilton,” said Gaunt. “Good morning to you. Put that ridiculous thing away. We won’t eat you.”
   Hamilton frowned, but he did not lower the weapon.
   “Stand back, please,” he said curtly; “I’ve come to fetch Tony, and nothing’s going to stop me.”
   Gaunt laughed sharply.
   “I shall not even attempt to dissuade you,” he countered. “Take him, with my blessing.”
   Hamilton frowned still more. This was too easy! However:
   “Come along, Tony,” he said. “Get a move on!”
   Tony had been standing motionless, staring dumbly, but now he broke out with:
   “No, no, John! You don’t understand. I can’t go now.”
   “Can’t be damned! You’re coming, Tony, whether you like it or not. Do I have to drag you out by the scruff of your neck?”
   “No, please, John, don’t make me go. You don’t know what you’re doing.”
   “Don’t I?” Hamilton walked quickly across the intervening space, his heels ringing on the flagstones. The doctor and his companion fell back before the threat of the pistol and he stopped a pace in front of Tony.
   How strange the boy looked, he thought. Were those tears in his eyes? His mouth was trembling like that of a child. In a gentler tone he spoke again.
   “Don’t be a fool, Tony! You’re coming with me, so don’t argue. I’m taking you out of this infernal hole for good. Those two devils can stay and rot, for all I care.”
   Tony hesitated, his brain working at lightning speed. If he stayed, there was just a chance… But he couldn’t hope to convince John now. Besides… No! He must stay. His face hardened and he folded his arms defiantly.
   “Sorry, John,” he said firmly, “but I’m not coming.”
   “Is that so?” The sunlight glinted on Hamilton’s pistol as he swung it up. Then, with a sharp crack, the hard steel descended on Tony’s unprotected head, and without a sound the young man crumpled up and fell at his feet.
   “Sorry, old boy,” Hamilton murmured, and turned to the gaping Tregellis.
   “Take him to the boat,” he ordered.
   The other ambled across, reluctantly surrendered his bludgeon, picked up the limp figure as if it had been that of a child, and made off down the corridor.
   Gaunt smiled sardonically.
   “I must say you have a way with you, Mr. Hamilton,” he remarked. “You have saved me a lot of bother.”
   Not troubling to reply, Hamilton followed his henchman. He was careful to avoid even looking at Gaunt, for he knew full well the power of those terrible eyes.
   He did not permit himself to relax until the launch was out of the harbour, and then he put away his gun and examined his prisoner.
   Tony lay quite still in the bottom of the boat, his face deadly pale and his eyes closed. There was a thin line of scarlet trickling from one nostril. Hamilton felt a vague alarm. Had he hit too hard? Hurriedly unbuttoning Tony’s shirt, he thrust his hand in and felt his heart. It was beating faintly, but steadily. With a sigh of relief he began bathing the bruised head with sea-water. He could feel a lump like an egg beneath the flaxen hair.
   What a pity Tony had been so obstinate, he reflected. Gaunt hadn’t even tried to interfere. Why not? He remembered the rector’s theory that the two Satanists were not really very much concerned over Tony, but wanted Kestrel for themselves. If that were so, they had got it now, for what use it was.
   Then it occurred to him that they were now marooned on the island, since he had interfered with Tregellis’ plan of returning the launch with a dinghy in tow to come back in. The launch was Tony’s property, and must remain at Pentock until he decided what to do. Hamilton gazed at the white, still face and sighed. What would he decide? Time alone could tell.
   Tony was still unconscious when they arrived at Pentock, but since, the fishing-boats were out, they managed to get him to the rectory without attracting undue attention.
   Valerie must have seen their approach from a window, for she was at the door as soon as they, crying:
   “Why, John, whatever’s happened?”
   “I’ll explain later. We must get him to bed at once.”
   At this juncture the rector, hearing the commotion, emerged from his study. Taking in the situation at a glance, he led the way upstairs to his own room, and there they laid Tony on the bed. Tregellis was then dispatched post-haste for Dr. Pellew.
   While he was gone Hamilton briefly explained what had happened. Valerie was bathing Tony’s head, and made no comment throughout the narrative, though she caught her breath sharply when Hamilton said he had been to Kestrel. The rector sat on the edge of the bed polishing his glasses. When the tale was told he put them on, saying:
   “There is a saying about fools and angels, John, but perhaps that is a little harsh in this instance. It was very brave of you to venture there again for the sake of your friend, and I honour you for it. But you are lucky to be here to tell the tale, I think. There must be a special Providence which watches over — impetuous fellows like yourself.” He smiled, then his face became grave again. “I pray God you have not played into their hands by doing this. It is certainly very odd that they offered no resistance. If Tony were their master card I feel they would not have let him go so easily. Ah, well, he shall be our chief consideration now, poor lad. It we can heal his wounded soul as easily as that bump on his head I shall be very happy.”
   When the doctor arrived he examined Tony briefly and announced that there was no cause for alarm.
   “He’s had a nasty crack, though, and there is a slight concussion. Rest, quiet, and cold-water bandages, Miss Bennett. It will probably be some hours before he comes round. I’ll call again later.”
   He asked no questions as to how Tony had come by his injury, but, since the rector had told him something of the happenings upon Kestrel, he probably had his suspicions.
   All that night Valerie, Hamilton, and the rector took turns to watch by the sick-bed; but when day broke the patient was still unconscious.
   At three o’clock in the afternoon Valerie, who had been asleep all morning, noticed a change in Tony’s appearance. He was breathing faster, and a little colour was creeping into his cheeks. The doctor, who had been in twice during the day, still maintained there was no need to worry; but she had to confess that she was growing a little anxious. Now she bent forward and watched the young man’s face eagerly.
   Presently his eyes opened and he stared up wonderingly at her.
   “Valerie?” he whispered doubtfully.
   She smiled reassuringly.
   “Yes, Tony. Don’t worry. You are in my uncle’s house. John brought you yesterday.”
   He lay quiet for a moment, taking it in. Then his hand crept up to his head and he felt the bandages, wincing as he touched the damaged place.
   “What happened?” he asked wearily.
   “You refused to come away with him, you know, and he thought it best to bring you, whether you wanted to or not. I’m afraid he hit you rather hard, but he didn’t mean to hurt you. There’s no serious harm done.”
   All at once Tony’s blue eyes widened, and he sat up, only to fall back with a groan of pain.
   “What’s the date?” he demanded surprisingly.
   She thought for a moment, then:
   “The twenty-first, I think,” she said. “Why?”
   “Four days to go — only four days — less! I must get back. Can I see John?”
   “I think he’s asleep now. Is it so very important?”
   “It’s vital. Please fetch him at once.”
   The urgency in his weak voice silenced the girl’s questions, and she went into the adjoining room and woke Hamilton, who presently appeared, clad in a dressing-gown, and sat on the edge of the bed.
   “I’m glad to see you’re better, old boy,” said he. “Sorry I had to lay you out, but you were so darned obstinate there was nothing else for it.”
   Tony smiled wryly and held out his hand. His friend took it silently, and he said:
   “I wish you hadn’t, John, all the same, because now I must get back as quickly as possible.”
   Hamilton sighed.
   “Do we have to go over all this again, Tony?” he asked.
   “No, you don’t understand. When you came butting in like a great bull yesterday Gaunt had just cast me off, after I had refused to help in what he proposed to do.”
   “What, you’re through with him?”
   “I can never be through with him altogether — I am bound by oath — but I refused to go on with this particular job.”
   “And this is…?”
   Tony replied with a quiet emphasis more convincing than any rhetoric:
   “The releasing of the curse-monstrosity upon its anniversary date, the twenty-fifth of this month.”
   Hamilton considered.
   “That’s four days from today. But why the excitement? I thought that was your intention all along.”
   “I was deceived in this as in many things. I believed we were to send the curse back whence it came out of this world for good. But Gaunt means to release itinto the world.”
   Hamilton stared.
   “What will that mean?” he asked.
   “The ruin of the human race,” said Tony quietly.
   “Good God!” Hamilton was on his feet. Then he sat down again, saying:
   “How do I know this is true? You may be just pulling my leg in order to get back.”
   “No, John, I swear it’s deadly serious. That thing is an evil entity of frightful power. Once it gets loose there’s no telling what may happen.”
   Hamilton got up again slowly.
   “You sound serious enough, Tony, but Heaven help you if there’s a catch in this. I’ll fetch the rector, and see what he has to say.”
   “That priest? What good will he do?”
   “He knows more about these matters than I do, Tony; and, I suspect, more than you do yourself.”
   Tony laughed bitterly.
   “I doubt it,” said he, “but bring him along if you must. Perhaps I can make him realize how serious this all is.”
   Shrugging his shoulders, Hamilton went out. Tony lay staring up at the ceiling with burning eyes. Could he convince these people of the dreadful urgency of the matter? And even if he could and did manage to get back to the Abbey, could he stop Gaunt? Knowing the doctor’s power, he doubted it. He gnashed his teeth in an agony of impotence.
   The rector came in alone.
   “Feeling better, Sir Anthony?” he inquired. “John tells me you’ve something very important to tell me.”
   Rapidly Tony repeated what he had told Hamilton. When he had finished the rector got up and paced the floor several times, beating his brow with his clenched fist.
   “Why didn’t I think of this?” he exclaimed. “Fool that I am! I knew that it wasn’t you yourself they wanted, but I never dreamed… Can you stop them if you go back?”
   “I don’t know,” Tony groaned. “I can try. By myself I could do nothing; I have no power over that thing now, but there is just one chance. I have an idea that Vaughan is no happier over the whole business than I am; the two of us might perhaps be able to stand against Gaunt.”
   “I shouldn’t count on Simon Vaughan,” said the rector; “he was ever a weak vessel. I knew him of old. But something must be done; that is evident. As soon as you are a little stronger I will go back with you; but that will not be today. You must rest now; perhaps tomorrow the doctor will let you get up.”
   “But time is getting so short,” Tony persisted. “There are only four days to go.”
   “Does it matter so very much how long before the actual date you get back?” asked the rector. “Surely another day will not make much difference.”
   “I’m not so sure,” Tony answered. “You see, sir, every hour the curse grows stronger, until it reaches its maximum at noon on the twenty-fifth. The sooner I attempt to interfere, the better.”
   “I see. Tell me, Sir Anthony, why are you so anxious to prevent this occurrence? You are one of them, are you not?”
   “I don’t know what I am.” Tony’s voice was weary and hopeless. “I believed I was, but now that I cannot face the consummation of their faith they will have no more to do with me.” He turned his face away, but not before the rector had seen the tears in his eyes.
   A deep pity stirred in the heart of the old priest.
   “Give this soul to me, dear Lord,” he prayed silently, “that I may bring him back to Thee.”
   He sat down beside the bed, and said gently:
   “Tell me how it all began.”
   The need for sympathy was so strong in Tony that he poured out his pitiful tale at once.
   “My life was empty, meaningless,” he said; “I realized that when my father died. And the awful responsibility of Kestrel was more than I could bear alone. I turned to Nicholas Gaunt, and he offered me knowledge and power whereby I could rid the world of that horrid thing for ever. More than that, he offered me a new philosophy which would show me the meaning of everything, and give me something definite to live for. I believed him. He taught me. I have learnt many strange and wonderful things from him, things that I could never have found by any other means — good things, noble things, spiritual truths, things that even now I can find no fault with. But all the while he was subtly at work, altering my sense of proportion, lowering my moral standards. I can see it all now, but at the time I was blinded by the light of new knowledge.
   “He showed me his faith in its most attractive aspect, suppressing all that was unpleasant. I came to believe that humanity was on the wrong track; that the God you worship was false, non-existent, merely called into a sort of phantasmal being by centuries of misguided worship; and that Christ was an insane egotist, blinded by his own conceit, who had somehow managed to foist a ridiculous creed on to his followers. A creed which, with its insistence upon humility and gentleness, had been the ruin of civilization, suppressing the god-like pride which is the birthright of man, and reducing him to the level of a slave, meekly accepting tyranny and oppression. You know that poem of Swinburne’s: ‘Before a Crucifix’?”
   “Yes, I know it,” the priest replied, quoting: “ ‘Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean, And the world has grown grey in thy breath.’ Very specious, but quite untrue. Please go on, if it isn’t tiring you too much.”
   “No, no, I must tell you the whole story now,” Tony said with breathless eagerness. “Well, eventually I came to be initiated. You must remember that all this time Gaunt had offered me no other form of worship in place of that which he had shown to be false. I must admit I felt the need of something more than mere knowledge, however wonderful, and at the ceremony it was revealed to me. I can’t possibly describe it — words are quite useless — and in any case I am under oath not to, but it suddenly dawned upon me what it was all about, that Satan was the one true Lord, to whom I was bound for ever.
   “I gladly accepted my new bondage, and until Valerie and John came to Kestrel I believed that all my troubles were over, and that I had reached harbour at last.
   “Then there came that awful business when Gaunt tried to destroy Valerie by means of the curse. I must frankly admit that she had upset my altered ideas of life; they no longer seemed all in all; but I couldn’t bring myself to believe that the wanton sacrifice of her life was in accordance withthe high principles that Gaunt had laid down. I told him as much, and he assured me that he had acted for my good and that she was not all I had thought her.”
   “He lied,” interrupted the priest angrily; “she is all that is good and pure. I know that.”
   “Yes,” Tony agreed sadly, “I know it too now. As soon as I saw her face again this afternoon I knew the wrong I had done her in believing Gaunt. But such was his power over me that he convinced me at the time, particularly since he gave me what I thought was visible proof of her unworthiness.”
   “What do you mean?” asked the priest sharply.
   “I saw a vision in the crystal — oh, it’s too beastly to describe — it must have been a trick; but I thought I knew them all.”
   Tony lay silent, brooding on his unhappy memories. Overcoming the wrath which had surged up in him at the slur on his niece, the rector inquired if there were any more to tell.
   Wondering what on earth was making him confide all the secrets of his troubled soul to this man whom he scarcely knew, Tony went on:
   “I was very angry with Valerie and John for the wrong which I imagined they had done me, and Gaunt persuaded me to assist at a Black Mass offered for their destruction.”
   The rector started violently, and only by a tremendous effort of will succeeded in remaining silent. He knew what the Black Mass entailed, and his soul sickened at the knowledge of the enormity which this wretched boy had been dragged into. His rage against the two who had been ultimately responsible made the blood thunder in his ears to such an extent that he had difficulty in hearing Tony’s words.
   “I think I was deceived again,” the young man continued, “because all that happened was that the curse-monstrosity was whipped into frightful fury, and in the pandemonium Gaunt made me relinquish whatever control I had over it to him.
   “After that I suppose they had no further use for me. I refused to help when Gaunt told me of his further plans, and they cast me out. I have been deceived all along the line. One thing Gaunt said when I expostulated with him has shown me that much of his teaching about his own creed must have been quite untrue. He had always denied the existence of your God, but when I protested against the ruining of this lovely world he said, ‘This world was created by the Power which we defy, and must perish at the last.’ ”
   A long silence fell while the priest racked his brains for the best way in which to approach this problem. At last he said:
   “Well, Tony, there is only one thing left for you to do. Deny them as they have denied you; as they have cast you out, so cast their abominable bondage from your soul, and come back to us.”
   Tony turned his sad eyes to the priest. He shook his head.
   “I do not think I shall ever believe anything any more,” said he. “I cannot tell which is true and which is false. It’s all so hopeless. I shall go back and make one last attempt to undo the harm I’ve done, and then I hope I die. At least I shan’t be able to do any more harm then.”
   “Nonsense!” said the rector sharply. “You have been sadly deceived, but that is all the more reason for coming back to the old faith. After all, it is the one stable thing in this unhappy world.”
   “What can you offer me?”
   “Nothing. They offered you the world and the glory of it in exchange for your own soul, and it turned to dust and ashes in your mouth. I offer you only perpetual bondage in the sweet yoke of Christ. He will give you the glory of His service, the burning reality of His great love, and the peace which passeth all understanding. Moreover, He will give you your own soul back again.”
   “It all sounds so vague, so full of aspiration, but achieving so little.”
   “So says the world. But we are not of the world. The martyrs found the faith strong enough to support them in the flame — they knew it was no illusory promise, lacking fulfillment.”
   “They gave me power and strength.”
   “He gives you service and weakness, the contradiction of all they teach; truth and beauty, pity and kindliness; all the lovely things which they reject. We rely not on our own poor mortal strength, but upon the infinite power of the Most High God, who was Himself content to suffer at our ignoranthands.”
   “There was a certain sombre glory in their worship,” Tony ventured.
   “The sombre glory of damnation,” the priest countered instantly. “Our worship is glorious enough with its ancient ritual, which they pervert to blasphemy, but more glorious than this is the inner knowledge of a soul at one with the Creator of all things.”
   “I wish I could believe as you do, sir,” said Tony in a voice tremulous with self-pity, “but I just can’t, that’s all.”
   “That is not to be wondered at, my son. You have never been instructed in the mysteries of our great faith, and you are still soiled by contact with their abominations. Will you put yourself unreservedly in my hands? I can promise you new life, new hope, and everlasting salvation.”
   “Gaunt said just the same. But I’ll give it a trial — afterwards. First I must get back to Kestrel.”
   While they had been talking the room had been growing steadily darker, and even as Tony spoke a distant mutter of thunder stirred the air. The rector went over to the window and looked out.
   The sky was heavily overcast and the wind was rising. Already the sea was showing its teeth in the white crests of the waves.
   “Not today, I’m afraid, my boy,” said he; “there’s another storm brewing.”
   Tony struggled into a sitting position, one hand to his bandaged head. Panic stared from his eyes.
   “A storm?” he gasped. “It’s his doing. I might have known. I shall never get back, and the world is doomed!”
   “Nonsense!” snapped the rector. “No man can control God’s sea.”
   “You don’t know Gaunt,” Tony groaned, falling back on his pillow. “Sometimes I wonder if he is a man at all, or a fiend in human form.”
   “Don’t imagine such vain things. This will be over well before the twenty-fifth; there’s plenty of time. At the moment your own soul is of far greater importance. Lie still and rest, and think over what I have told you.”
   He went out, leaving Tony alone. For a long time the young man lay there listening to the sound of the rising storm, which mirrored so truly the battle raging in his own heart.
   Chapter XVIII
   Dr. Pellew gave Tony permission to get up next morning, and after breakfast he sat by the fire in the rector’s study, a prey to the most gloomy imaginings.
   The first violence of the storm had passed with the night, but, though the rain had ceased and the thunder was silent, the wind still roared tempestuously round the house, and the booming of the surf penetrated to every room.
   Presently Valerie came, wearing a mackintosh, a prayer-book in her hand. His heart leapt at the sight of her, for his love had been reborn in all its strength with the passing of the shadows which had come from Vaughan’s evil mind, but he did not allow himself to show it, deeming himself unworthy for ever having doubted her.
   “I’m going to church, Tony,” she announced. “Would you care to come?”
   A refusal leapt automatically to his lips, then he stopped. After all, why not? He would be close to her, at least, and it would be interesting to see what all this business was that they made so much of.
   With sweet solicitude she helped him into a mackintosh: his own, in point of fact, the one he had lent her when she had left Kestrel. She pointed this out to him gaily, but his answering smile was sombre.
   He was scarcely aware of their passage through the rectory garden and the churchyard. His whole being seemed torn in two struggling halves: one frantically rebelling from the idea of entering that small grey building, with its squat tower, the other consumed by a strange longing. In the porch he hesitated, but she tugged at his arm, and they went in.
   They slipped into a pew at the back, and she knelt to pray. He sat down, silently refusing to make a show of reverence he did not feel.
   It was Sunday, and the little church was nearly full. One or two of the villagers near by glanced curiously in his direction, recognizing the young master of Kestrel, but for the most part they did not heed him, for the corner in which he sat was dark and inconspicuous.
   He glanced round at the images and pictures, and all the paraphernalia of worship, but without great curiosity, for he had been here once before, on the occasion of his father’s funeral. Looking at the High Altar, with its six lights and snowy cloth, he remembered the last time he had seen an illuminated altar, and his lips twitched slightly, but whether in sorrow or amusement he scarcely knew himself.
   The bell ceased its tolling, scarcely audible above the sound of the wind, and the sacristy bell tinkled. The congregation rose like one man as the little procession came out of the vestry and wound its way into the sanctuary. First the thurifer, with his diminutive boat-boy, and the acolytes, splendid in scarlet and lace; then the rector, very dignified in his glittering vestments, preceded by the master of ceremonies, clad in a plain black cassock and short linen surplice. Tony was surprised to recognize Hamilton in this unfamiliar garb. He had not realized that John was keen on this sort of thing.
   The organ burst into song, and the boys’ choir joined their high, clear voices with its deep melody.
   After the Preparation the thurifer came forward, a silver censer twinkling in his gloved hands; the priest blessed incense, and scattered the grains of aromatic gum upon the glowing charcoal. The blue smoke rose in clouds, ringing the candle-flames with golden haloes, and the fragrant odour quickly permeated the whole building. It occurred to Tony that this must be different incense from that which he had burnt in the dark crypt beneath the Abbey— less pungent, more sweet, not stupefying.
   With quickened interest he watched the intricate ceremonial. How like, and yet how unlike, the dark mysteries he had assisted at! Here was no double meaning, no sinister intention. All was simple and direct, showing forth as in a mirror the worship of God in the beauty of holiness. He observed the simple faces of the servers as they went about their business with the precision of well-drilled soldiers. They believed all this! Strange. His mind stood apart, remote, watchful. The Mass went on.
   After the Creed had been sung the rector removed his chasuble and went into the pulpit. Tony half expected that the sermon would be directed at himself, and waited, rather resentfully, for the opening words. But the rector delivered a discourse on the devotion due to the Blessed Virgin, a subject which Tony felt was rather remote from his own immediate needs. Apparently he was not the most important person in the world! Amused at his own childishness, he let his attention wander, and his eyes strayed to the figure of the Virgin which stood on the left of the chancel screen.
   He considered the cold purity of the sculptured features, mentally comparing them with the warm, living face of the girl at his side. Stealing a glance at her, he was surprised to note a certain resemblance. Odd, he thought; and then with a sudden rush of contrition he acknowledged that it was meant that it should be so. That statue represented the highest and holiest form of womanhood that these people could imagine. Was it not just that Valerie, who stood in his mind for all that was good and pure, should show forth in her face that same glory which had shone from the countenance of her whom they called the Mother of God?
   This recognition awoke in his mind some faint perception of the innate naturalness of the Christian religion, and he felt his attitude changing imperceptibly as the bonds of that other worship slackened about his heart.
   The sermon ended, the rector took his place once more at the altar, and the interrupted service continued. The bread and wine were offered to their Creator, and the moment of Consecration approached. All at once Tony became aware of a new atmosphere in the church. His clairvoyant faculties, trained and intensified by long weeks of preparation, revealed to him the eager expectancy which gripped the kneeling congregation. On every side of him minds were reaching out towards the altar, as with a quivering earnestness the people prepared to worship the coming Presence.
   Despite himself a sense of awe began to steal over Tony. Angrily he strove to shake it off— this was unreal, auto-suggestion, mass-hypnotism! Therewas no God, only a shadowy thought-form conjured up by credulous worshipers; there could be no real Presence in the sacrament. But, strive as he would, he could not deny the inner knowledge that grew steadily stronger in his heart: something tremendous was about to happen, and every soul in the church knew it, welcomed it, but he.
   “Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest!” rang out the clear voices of the choir. The organ ceased its playing, and an almost painful silence fell within the building. From the sanctuary came the low, continuous muttering of the priest as he recited the Canon of the Mass. The censer swung rhythmically, emitting little puffs of smoke beside the altar; the six golden spears of the tall candles burnt with an unwavering flame. The supreme moment was at hand.
   Tony felt as if he were stretched upon the rack, the already well-nigh unbearable tension increasing every second. An awful chasm of suspense yawned in the pit of his stomach. He gripped the back of the seat before him until his fingernails grew white with the pressure, as with startling eyes he glared at the bowed figure of the priest.
   The murmuring voice ceased, and the rector bent his head to whisper the miraculous words.
   The sanctuary bell tinkled softly thrice, and the chains of the censer rattled as the kneeling thurifer censed the Host. The priest genuflected, then raised the Sanctissimum high above his head for all to see. A great wave of adoration swept over the people, like the wind over a field of corn, and every head was bowed. The Presence of God throbbed and quivered upon the altar.
   With the breaking of the tension Tony’s attitude of mind changed abruptly. A blind rage swept through him: rage against that holy Thing these people worshipped. He wanted to rend, destroy, defile It. Shaking with fury, he half rose from his knees. Quickly Valerie laid her hand upon his.
   At the touch of her cool fingers sanity returned, and, quelling his anger, he sank down once more.
   Then followed the consecration of the Chalice, and at the second Elevation Tony’s eyes were opened, and he saw that which is rarely given to mortal sight.
   What happened he could never afterwards remember, but the impression of that moment remained with him till he died. For a fraction of time the painted shadows of this material world faded from his eyes, and he beheld the awful reality which lies behind the Sacramental Presence.
   Perhaps he saw an anguished Body, writhing upon a rough cross of wood, surrounded by a jeering multitude; perhaps a manger, with a tiny Babe, and grave-eyed kings adoring; perhaps even an effulgent Throne, flanked by rank upon serried rank of guardian figures, with folded, mighty wings.
   For an instant of Time, for an age of Eternity, those terrible, gentle eyes looked into his, and his soul cried out in agony. Then the vision passed, the world resumed its sway, and he was in the little church once more, and the choir were singing Agnus Dei.
   The remainder of the service passed like a dream, and long after it was over and the people had all gone Tony remained motionless on his knees. At last Valerie touched him gently.
   Slowly, painfully, he lifted his head and stared at her. She smiled uncertainly, half frightened by his blank, unseeing gaze. Recognition crept slowly back into his eyes, and in a hoarse whisper he told her that he must speak to the rector at once.
   As they went up the aisle he staggered like a drunken man, and she caught his arm. He clung to her gratefully, and together they reached the sacristy door, just as the rector, who had finished unvesting, came out.
   He gave one glance at Tony’s ravaged face, then gestured to Valerie to leave them. Bereft of her support, Tony sank down on to a bench. As soon as she was gone the rector sat down beside him:
   “Well, Tony, what is it?” he asked gently.
   The young man turned his head stiffly and stared at him. The rector was shocked at his appearance. His face was rigid, and pale as death. His eyes were sunk in their sockets, and burned with an unnatural lustre. He opened his lips, and spoke in a voice that was scarcely audible:
   “At the Consecration — I saw — Oh, God help me!”
   The last exclamation was a cry of agony. Abruptly he fell on his knees, burying his face in the priest’s lap. His whole frame was racked with harsh, dry sobs. The old man stroked his hair as gently as a woman, saying:
   “I prayed that this would happen, my son. Be of good heart, the Mercy has not failed.”
   “Is there any hope for me?” Tony’s voice was muffled by the priest’s cassock.
   “There is always hope. You will make your confession now, and I will give you Absolution, for I can see that you are truly penitent.”
   “But I have committed the unforgivable sin: I have defiled the Blessed Sacrament!”
   “So did we all nineteen hundred years ago, on Calvary. It shall be forgiven. There is no sin beyond forgiveness save the ultimate rejection of the love of God.”
   “But I am bound to them by oaths which may not be broken. If I reject them I shall be instantly destroyed.”
   “They lied when they told you that, as they have lied since their Master first rebelled against the One True God. Come, my son!”
   The authority in the priest’s voice was irresistible, and together they went into the confessional.
   Much that Tony told him was a repetition of what he had heard the previous day, but the rector remained silent as a priest should until the miserable tale was finished. Then, being satisfied of his penitent’s contrition, he gave the Absolution.
   “… And by His authority committed unto me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
   As the blessed words were uttered Tony felt peace such as he had never dreamed of descend upon his tortured soul. The battle was over, Light had conquered, and Darkness was vanquished for ever.
   Early next morning Tony made his Communion, and his repentance was sealed.
   He remained alone in the church for some time after the short, simple service, reflecting upon the great change which had so suddenly come upon him.
   Even now he could scarcely realize that he was no longer a member of that dark brotherhood, vowed to wage war continually against the religion of Christ, but he knew that he had at last found that which he had been seeking— a purpose in life and a sense of fulfillment and peace.
   He recognized that, hate him how he would, he was nevertheless indebted to Gaunt for many things. Good had come out of evil in his case, for the ancient curse of his family had passed from him, and had made his repentance easier. He carried no secret burden as his ancestors had done; his soul was free. Whether this could have come to pass without his passing through the Valley of the Shadow, so close to everlasting damnation, he did not know, but he was filled with deep thankfulness that it was so.
   He had had a long talk with the rector on the previous day, and the old man had assured him that he was not entirely to blame for the wrong turning which he had taken, for the continual drain of power and virtue which the curse had made upon him, as upon all his predecessors, had made Gaunt’s task of leading him astray all the easier. In the circumstances he could scarcely have resisted the doctor’s will, so intent had he been upon dominating him.
   He was also surprised to find that his powers of intense mental concentration and clairvoyance had not departed from him, as he had half expected them to do, upon his conversion. Only the instinctive use of them in the service of evil was gone. He recognized that they were not wrong in themselves, and that he could now use his awakened transcendental faculties for their proper end— namely, in the mystical approach to God.
   He looked towards the curtained Tabernacle and was instantly aware of the living Presence within it. He could feel the Sacred Heart beating there in unison with That which lay in his own breast. Humbly thanking God for this wonderful gift of spiritual insight, he rose, genuflected, and left the church.
   Coming out into the open, he observed that the wind had almost ceased and that the sky, though still clouded, was bright with the sun behind. It seemed that the storm was over, and that he would be able to return to Kestrel well before the eleventh hour and do what yet remained for him to prevent Gaunt carrying out his fiendish plan at whatever cost. With this resolve strong in his heart Tony went into the rectory.
   He found that the others had waited for him, and soon the four of them were sitting round the breakfast-table, eating and talking cheerfully. The rector had told Valerie and Hamilton that Tony had made his peace with God at the young man’s own request, but even if he had not done so the inward light which shone through his eager face would have told its own story.
   His blue eyes were calm and happy and his lips were set in firm lines, but with no trace of grimness. This was the old Tony, thought Hamilton; but there was a repose and sense of purpose about him which had been lacking in the old days. There was humility also in the manner in which he deferred to the old priest over some trivial matter, which almost brought a lump into his friend’s throat, so different was it from the arrogant and carefree boy he used to know.
   When the meal was over and tobacco-smoke was perfuming the air of the study Tony broached the matter of his return to the Abbey.
   The rector took his pipe from his mouth and regarded him steadily.
   “You still feel that the matter is important, then?” he asked.
   “Tremendously important, Father,” Tony answered with quiet emphasis. “You do not know Gaunt as I do. His power is terribly real, and he is absolutely certain that, when he releases this horror, it will do incalculable harm.”
   “If that is so I cannot think that God will permit it,” said the old man, “but since you feel to some extent responsible it is only right that you should endeavour to prevent him. How you will set about it I do not profess to know. You know more about these matters than I do. At all events the storm seems to be practically over. We will go down to the harbour this morning and see what the sea looks like.”
   Shortly afterwards Hamilton, Tony, and the rector set off. As soon as they reached the cliff path they could see that there was little hope of making a crossing at once. Although the wind had dropped to a mere breeze, the waves were mountainous, and dashed upon the rocks below with terrific force.
   Down at the harbour the position was even clearer. All the boats, including Tony’s launch, had been beached, and the harbour mouth was impassable. The rector asked one of the little knot of fishermen standing on the quay if there were any possibility of getting to the island, but the man shook his head decidedly.
   “Not today, Father,” he said. “I’ve never seen a sea like this, not in thirty year. ’Taint natural, not after such a little blow.”
   Tony looked sharply at his companions, as much as to say,‘I told you so!’ But without further words they returned to the rectory.
   Before going in they stopped on the steep path and looked across to where the island lay. It looked so near, but it was as remote— cut off by that stretch of heaving water — as if it had been on the moon. Tony wondered desperately what was going on there, but he said nothing.
   After lunch Hamilton and the rector went for a walk, leaving Tony, who seemed disinclined for exercise, sitting by the study fire. He stared into the heart of the glowing coals, smoking cigarette after cigarette, gradually sinking deeper into the pit of despondency. After his exaltation of the morning this setback was all the more depressing.
   He was roused from his gloomy reverie by a light touch on his shoulder, and Valerie sat down on the settee beside him. He offered her a cigarette, and when it was lit she said:
   “Tony, you mustn’t give way like this. Everything will be all right. Things can’t be as bad as you think.”
   “But they are — perhaps worse,” he countered. “If I can’t get over there in time there’s no telling what may happen.”
   “Uncle seems to think that God won’t let them do any harm,” she reminded him.
   “I know, but I can’t feel so sure. It would entail direct intervention, you see, and it is an axiom among these Satanists that no direct intervention has taken place since the birth of Christ. There must always be a human agent to carry out the Divine Will. I had hoped to be that agent in this case.”
   “And if God doesn’t choose you you will lose your trust in Him? Oh, Tony, I thought better things of you than that!”
   “I want to justify your faith in me, Valerie. That wish has been the mainspring of my actions ever since you came to Kestrel.”
   “I’m glad,” she said simply. “But you must accept God’s providence. He will do what He thinks best, in His own time.”
   “I’ll try, but it’s desperately hard. You are very good to me, Valerie.”
   “You have been good to me, Tony. Twice you have saved me, once from death and once from something far worse. I can never repay you for that.”
   “God knows I want no repayment. I would lay down my life for you — you know that, Valerie. I have loved you from the first moment I set eyes upon your blessed face. Do you think you could care for me a little?”
   There was infinite pleading in his voice, but he did not look at her. Touched to the heart, she laid her hand on his.
   “I’m terribly fond of you, Tony.”
   Quickly he turned and caught her, incredulous wonder in his eyes.
   “You mean that, my darling?”
   “Of course I mean it,” she answered softly.
   “I never dared to hope — I can’t believe — If — when all this is over, will you marry me? I need you so!”
   She had not meant all that he took for granted, but faced with the eagerness in his eyes she knew that she could not draw back. Refusal would hurt him horribly. Very quietly she whispered:
   “Yes, Tony, I’ll marry you if you want me.”
   “My precious darling!”
   He drew her close, kissing her sweet mouth, tenderly at first, then passionately, straining her against him as if he would never let her go. For a moment she only submitted to his ardour, then the young passion rose in her also and her arms went about his neck.
   So they remained for many minutes while the world went by unheeded, but at last he released her and she lay quiet in his arms, her eyes closed. His senses were reeling as he kissed her hair, whispering:
   “Dear heart, I can face anything now. I’ll never be afraid any more.”
   She looked up at him shyly, but said nothing, hiding her lovely face in his breast.
   When they heard the sound of the rector and Hamilton coming in she gently disengaged his arms and stood up, patting her disheveled curls into place.
   “Let me tell John, Tony dear,” said she. “I’m afraid he’s in love with me too, and this will be rather a blow for him.”
   “Of course.” Tony was all sympathy. “Poor old John, I can understand how he’ll feel.”
   So when Hamilton entered, bringing with him a breath of the keen fresh air, Tony slipped out without a word.
   “What’s the matter with him?” inquired Hamilton, sitting down beside the girl; “he looked a bit queer.”
   “It’s all right, John,” she answered; “I’ve got something to tell you, and I’m afraid it’s going to hurt you rather.”
   He looked at her sharply, and she went on:
   “Tony has asked me to marry him, and I have agreed.”
   Hamilton sat like a graven image. Not a muscle of his face moved. His voice was perfectly controlled as he said:
   “I’m glad, Valerie. I hope you will be very happy.”
   “Thank you, John dear. I knew you’d take it well. You’re such a splendid sport. There’s no need to pretend. I know you love me, and I’m tremendously proud, but Tony needs me so much more than you do. He’s so helpless and weak sometimes. You are so strong, so self-sufficient. You will get over it — he wouldn’t. I just couldn’t turn him down; he’s had so much trouble lately, and this would have broken his heart.”
   “Do you love him? Forgive me, but I have the right to ask.”
   “I can, I must. I’m frightfully sorry for him, and most awfully fond. I shall do my best to make him happy.”
   “I know that, bless you. If it was anyone but Tony I would not give you up so easily, but since I love you both I must accept your decision. My dear, you have a great heart. God grant it may never be broken.”
   He took her hand and raised it to his lips. Then he stood up, smiling slightly to hide the pain, and went out, his head erect.
   Valerie thought he had never looked so fine as he did then: his face pale beneath its tan, and his crisp dark hair ruffled slightly with the wind. A sudden pang of regret shot through her heart, but she stifled it resolutely. She had made her choice, and she must abide by it or be for ever shamed.
   Chapter XIX
   Tony awoke with a feeling that something very wonderful had happened. Then he remembered— Valerie loved him and had promised to marry him. He lay still and thought of the happy hours they had spent together; how Hamilton had shaken him warmly by the hand, frankly envious of his good fortune; and how the rector had blessed them both. A deep sense of happiness pervaded his whole being, and he thanked God for this great gift with a full heart.
   It was some minutes before he realized how hot it seemed and how strange was the early-morning light that filtered in through the window.
   He got out of bed with something of an effort and flung the casement wide, leaning out. There was no wind, and the still air was dry and parched. The sun was invisible, hidden by a thin haze, through which it shone with a dull coppery light. How still it was! No birds were singing in the garden, no gulls crying about the cliffs. Perhaps the sea also would be calm, and he would be able at last to get back to Kestrel. There was little time to spare, he thought, beginning to dress slowly; today was the twenty-fourth and at noon on the morrow Gaunt would set his fiendish plan in operation.
   Valerie was pale and quiet when she appeared at the breakfast-table. The heat oppressed her, she said, and she had a headache. It was generally agreed that the extraordinary change in the weather must have come at about three o’clock that morning, for the rector remembered having woken at about that hour, throwing some of the coverings from off his bed.
   When the meal was over they all went out on to the cliffs in front of the house. A dense haze, of the same hue as the sky, hung over the sea. They could just make out the water at the foot of the cliffs, and it appeared to be dead calm, but farther out the mist was impenetrable, and the island was hidden from their anxious eyes. Full of hope, Tony led the way down to the harbour.
   Here they found an extraordinary state of affairs. Every able-bodied member of the village’s small population seemed to be on the waterfront. They were standing about in groups, talking excitedly and pointing out to sea. The mist was thickening rapidly, pouring in through the harbour mouth in great clouds.
   Who first observed the little party from the rectory it was impossible to say, but it was only a matter of seconds before everyone knew of their presence. The talking ceased abruptly and scores of pairs of eyes were turned towards them.
   The rector spoke sharply, asking the nearest what the matter was, but they only shuffled their feet, avoiding his gaze. From the back of the crowd a sudden muttering sprang up, to be instantly silenced as the old man turned his eyes in that direction. Spying one of his own servers, he made for him, the people falling back to let him through.
   Taking the boy by the arm, he spoke to him. The other hesitated for a moment then burst into voluble speech, flinging his arm seawards. His tones were too low for Hamilton and his companions to hear what he said, and Valerie moved closer to Tony, catching his hand.
   “What does it mean?” she whispered anxiously.
   Tony shook his head.
   “We shall soon know,” he answered, for the rector was returning, his face grave.
   “Come,” he said when he reached them, “we can’t talk here.”
   They turned back towards the rectory, and as soon as they were out of earshot of the crowd he told them what he had learned.
   “It seems that just before sunrise this morning two of the men went down to the quay to find out how rough the sea was. To their surprise, a dead calm had fallen, and they were just going back to their homes when one of them noticed the Abbey, just visible in the dawn. It sounds incredible, I know, but they swear that a heavy mist was pouring from the battlements and spreading over the sea about the island. They thought at first that the place was on fire, and that it was smoke they saw, but no flames appeared, and the mist went on spreading. Soon the island was hidden, and now it has reached the land, though it doesn’t seem to come any further. It’s getting thicker on the water every minute.”
   Tony, white to the lips, uttered one word:
   “Gaunt!”
   “That’s what the people think,” continued the rector. “They know that your two former friends are still on Kestrel and they are convinced that they are working witchcraft. I expect Tregellis has been talking.”
   “They’re probably quite right,” Tony groaned. “He couldn’t keep the storm up any longer, so now he has hidden the island in a fog. I couldn’t find it now, no matter how I tried.”
   “Oh, I’ve no doubt it’s still there;” the rector made a valiant attempt to be cheerful. “Don’t let us rate his power too high. But the tide-race is far too treacherous to navigate blind. You would be hopelessly lost.”
   No one said anything further— there seemed to be nothing to say. This last demonstration of Gaunt’s power — for it was impossible to regard it as anything else — had swept away the last shred of scepticism from the minds of them all.
   They climbed slowly back towards the rectory, Valerie clinging to Tony’s arm, and Hamilton, with the rector, a few paces behind. The scene was indescribably weird. There was the rectory, with the church behind, and the brow of the hill beyond, all clear in the ruddy light. On the other side of the path, a few yards of grass extended to the edge of the cliff, and beyond that there was nothing but an impenetrable wall of copper-coloured fog, rising sheer to the sky above, where it merged into the thin haze veiling the sun.
   Hamilton climbed over the wire fence and walked perilously close to the brink, thrusting out his arm. His hand and wrist were hidden in the dense vapour.
   “It feels hot,” he reported when he rejoined them, “and smells rather peculiar. Something like the smoke from a slag-heap.”
   They went indoors and discussed the problem until lunch-time without arriving at any conclusion. The most fantastic methods of reaching the island were suggested, from aeroplane to submarine, but all were rejected as valueless. The rector spent some time in church, but when he came back they could see at once that he had had no sign.
   All that day the heat grew stronger, until by evening the men had discarded their jackets, and were stretched out in deck-chairs on the lawn, their shirt-collars loosened, moving as little as possible. The very idea of food was nauseating, but Valerie, wearing a brief tennis frock, brought cooling drinks, and they all sat together talking, talking interminably.
   The fog over the sea had not changed at all, and hung in a great curtain for miles along the coast. Not a breath of air stirred; all animal life was hushed, and a deathly silence lay upon the sweltering land.
   Although the day had been dull the night was unusually light, for a queer reddish glow appeared to emanate from the fog-bank and from the veiled sky. They tried desperately to behave naturally, but each knew that the world stood on the brink of some terrible cataclysm. They went to bed at the usual hour, but no one closed his eyes during the long watches of that awful night.
   Hamilton, lying practically naked on top of the bed-clothes, his body damp with sweat, stared into the crimson gloom, thinking of Faustus’ last words.
   “Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven, that time may cease, and midday never come!” he paraphrased. However slowly the hours dragged, they still went far too fast, for every tick of the clock brought nearer that fated moment when death and destruction would be loosed upon mankind.
   There was no hope for the world now, unless God intervened, he told himself. He had not intervened to stop the countless wars and famines, earthquakes, plagues and desolations of the past. Would He come now, in all His might and majesty, to save His children from the final victory of the Adversary? Desperately Hamilton tried to believe that He would. He clenched his teeth, praying fiercely, savagely almost.
   At last, unable to bear the inaction any longer, he got up and poured the contents of his wash-stand jug over his head. The water was lukewarm and unrefreshing. He dried himself, slipped on some clothes, and went quietly downstairs and out into the garden.
   The light from the glowing sky was almost as strong as that of a full moon, and he walked up and down for a while, smoking his pipe. The air was stale and flat, burning the lungs.
   Presently he knocked out his pipe and went into the church, the door of which he found unlocked.
   Inside it was very dark, but he groped his way to a seat and sank down gratefully. It seemed a little cooler here, and not so difficult to breathe. A solitary white flame flickered before the Tabernacle, giving little illumination but shining brightly on the silver crucifix behind. He fixed his eyes upon this eternal symbol of hope and in a little while fell asleep.
   When he awoke a dim reddish light was struggling in through the small windows of the nave. He stretched painfully, stiff from his cramped position. His sleep had not refreshed him, and there was an unpleasant metallic taste in his mouth.
   He became aware of a faint whispering from one of the pews on the opposite side of the church, and was able to make out the figures of Tony and Valerie, sitting very close together. They, too, had sought this sanctuary during the night. They were aware of his presence, for when he moved his feet on the stone floor Tony looked round and called softly:
   “Are you awake, John?”
   Receiving an affirmative reply, he went on:
   “You looked so peaceful we hadn’t the heart to disturb you. The rector will be here presently to say Mass.”
   Hamilton looked at his wrist-watch, the luminous figures glowing brightly in the gloom. It was after six— the morning must be unusually dark, he thought.
   They did not speak to each other again, but sat still, each busy with his own thoughts. Hamilton found himself wondering if this were the last morning the world would ever know. Was evil to triumph thus? He could not believe it, and yet what hope was there? In less than six hours’ time Nicholas Gaunt would loose his hellish powers, and the old, joyful world would be blasted for ever. Never would the happy birds sing again, never would he see the light on the face of a child. His heart was like lead in his breast, and his thoughts moved sluggishly, like footsteps in a dream.
   When at last the rector came, opening the door to let in no flood of early sunlight but only an angry crimson glow, Hamilton got slowly to his feet and followed the priest into the little sacristy.
   The old man said no word, but began to vest at once. Hamilton saw that he was putting on red vestments, and knew that he intended to say the Mass of the Holy Ghost in a last appeal to the love of God.
   He himself put on cassock and surplice, and, taking a taper, he went out to light the altar candles. It was so dark that he lit the tall standard candles in the sanctuary also, making a little pool of light in the midst of the obscurity.
   Tony and Valerie formed the only congregation, and Hamilton could see their faces as two pale blurs beyond the chancel screen. Even in the church the heat was now appalling, and Hamilton marveled at the rector’s apparent unconcern, clad as he was in the heavy, clinging garments of his office. But the old man said the Mass with the same care and concentration which he had always known. It was a tremendous encouragement to watch his precise, ordered movements, and to hear his low, clear voice as he stood at the altar, seemingly quite unmoved by the approaching catastrophe. His faith was truly inspiring, and as the service proceeded all three felt their faltering spirits raised by his heartening example.
   A disconcerting little incident occurred at the Consecration, for when Hamilton attempted to ring the handbell to announce the coming of the Presence it emitted no sound. Why, he never discovered. It may have been some quite trivial mechanical defect, but at the time it made a profound impression upon his mind, more so even than all the other weird phenomena which had gone before. It seemed to him that matter itself was now leagued against the God Who had created it.
   They all made their Communion together, but Hamilton, at least, felt that he had never made so unprofitable a use of the Sacrament. The sublime act of union with Christ made no impression upon him whatsoever. His spiritual faculties seemed quite dead. Truly this was the dark night of the soul.
   When it was over the rector unvested and knelt for a while before the Tabernacle to say his thanksgiving. The others left the church together.
   If it had been almost unbearably hot within the building it was a thousand times worse in the open air. For a moment all three stood aghast, reeling against the sides of the porch. The still air was like the breath of a furnace, and was full of the smell of fire. Overhead the lowering sky shone like a sea of blood, and the great wall of fog reflected its lurid glow. An ominous silence hung over the whole earth.
   As they dragged their weary limbs towards the rectory Valerie pointed mutely to the flower-beds, where the blooms hung black and withered from their stems. The unspoken thought throbbed in each mind: if this is but a presage of the coming disaster, what will the ghastly reality be like?
   They were making a miserable pretence of eating when the rector came in. At once they were aware of a new atmosphere in the room, an atmosphere of hope. Breathlessly they waited for him to speak. He stood for a moment in the doorway, looking at them, a little smile on his lips. Then he said:
   “Do not despair, my children; all may yet be well. God will not suffer His people to perish utterly. He spoke to me this morning, as He has always spoken; not in words, you understand, but through the inward sense. We will go to Kestrel at once.”
   For a moment there was a stupefied silence, broken by Tony, who asked:
   “But how, Father? You said yourself that we could never find it in the fog.”
   “I spoke hastily, my son. Guidance will be given if we have faith. God has chosen one of us as His agent, but which one I do not know. We will all go together.”
   “Valerie, too, Father?”
   “Yes. She will be in no more danger there with us than here alone, whether we succeed or fail. But I do not think we shall fail.”
   Tony said no more, but stood up with a gesture of resignation. The thought was in his mind that perhaps the frightful tension of the last few hours had unhinged the old man’s brain, but he did not give it voice.
   Impelled by a sudden, unaccountable impulse, Hamilton excused himself and rushed upstairs to his room, where he got out the pistol which had stood him in good stead once before. Making sure that it was ready for use, he thrust it into his pocket. Whatever Gaunt’s superhuman powers, seven heavy leaden bullets in his vitals might prove a powerful argument if all else failed, he thought, even if silver bullets were the traditional ammunition against such as he.
   When he joined them the others were ready to start, and so the four of them set out: two men, a frail old priest, and a girl, against all the panoply of hell.
   Chapter XX
   I
   Simon Vaughan flung the empty sardine-tin among its fellows on the floor and lit his last cheroot. Soon it would be time for him to join his colleague in the crypt, and he was weary unto death.
   For four days he had assisted Gaunt in his efforts to prevent Tony’s return to the island, and the strain was beginning to tell. Neither of them had slept at all, but whereas the doctor seemed to thrive on the unnatural life, Vaughan’s flabby face was drawn and sunken, and there were purple stains beneath his red-rimmed eyes. Even now his great head nodded, and the cigar hung limply from his lips.
   The kitchen where he sat was in a state of disorder that would have wrung Mrs. Lorrimer’s heart. A pile of gutted tins and broken bottles showed how the two had lived since they had been left alone, and the remains of a fire smouldered on top of a great heap of ashes in the hearth, for it was very cold within the Abbey walls. An untrimmed lamp flickered on the bare, dirty table.
   Presently the cheroot fell from Vaughan’s lips and he roused himself and picked it up with a sigh. Resting his head on his hands, he began to go through the same sequence of thoughts which had weighed upon him ever since that fateful morning when Tony had rebelled against Gaunt. How he envied the young man, free and out of the doctor’s power for ever! Would that he himself had the courage to follow in his footsteps, but he knew that he had not. He would go through with it to the end, helping to bring about a consummation he had no real desire to see. He knew now that he had been deluding himself ever since he had become one of the brotherhood of Darkness. He had delighted in foulness and blasphemy unspeakable against his former faith, but deep in his heart he had never made the ultimate rejection of beauty and every work of God which was the mark of the true Satanist. He did not wish to see the world blasted any more thanTony did — he was too fond of his own comfort. What of wine and the beauty of women? Were they of no account?
   He realized that he had never loved evil for its own sake, as Gaunt did, living life almost monastic in its severity. He had merely welcomed this creed as an excuse to give his sensual desires full rein, while at the same time it gave him temporal power, which he loved, and an elaborate ritual of worship which he delighted in. Gaunt’s condemnation of Tony included him also. He could not welcome the ultimate triumph of Satan any more than he.
   Had he never been a priest, he thought, he might have married and lived a normal life; a trifle intemperate and passionate, perhaps, but no worse than thousands of others. But he had been unable to endure the rigorous continence of the Roman priesthood, and his passions, turned from their proper channels, had led him into unseemly perversions. He had been exposed, cast out, and the swing of the pendulum had carried him into the hands of Nicholas Gaunt and the Order of Satan. The continual demand in that quarter for apostate priests to celebrate the Black Mass had made him a welcome addition to their ranks. And now here he was, a lecherous old man, for he shuddered to think how old he really was, trembling before the imminent destruction of the only world he knew.
   He lifted his head sharply. The wordless summons had sounded in his brain: Gaunt was ready and waiting for him. With something very like a groan he hauled himself to his feet and made his way slowly down to the crypt.
   Gaunt was kneeling before the altar, clad in his ceremonial robes of white linen, with their symbolic embroidery in red. A flaring lamp beside him cast his shadow across the diagram on the floor. As the other approached he raised his head and looked at him. His face was leaner than ever, and the thin nose stood out like the beak of a predatory bird. His sunken eyes glowed like live coals, following Vaughan’s ponderous movements as he bent over the open trunk, taking out his own vestments and putting them on hastily.
   The doctor rose from his knees and came down the altar steps, stopping a few paces short of his colleague. His eyes never left the other’s face. So challenging was his attitude that Vaughan, after glancing at him uneasily several times, finally stood still and met his gaze.
   “Are you ready, Simon?” the doctor purred.
   “Yes, Master.” Vaughan’s eyes dropped, and he shuffled his feet. Gaunt’s lip curled, and he went on:
   “And willing?”
   “Of course!”
   “Good! You will have more to do than I anticipated.”
   “What do you mean?” A thin note of alarm crept into Vaughan’s voice.
   “I have been watching them. Intervention is on the way. They are coming, through the mist, guided by the ministers of Light. They will be here before noon.”
   “But they cannot get in. The gates are barred.”
   “I know, but we must take no chances now. They may be given power — I could not see, the future was hidden. So I propose to put my alternative plan into operation, Simon.”
   The other stood motionless, his eyes dilating with terror.
   “Not — not the Veil?” he quavered.
   “Yes. If I merely release the monstrosity it may be days — months even — before there is any effect. Much may happen in the interim — even Judgment. It is too slow to rely upon. Therefore I am going to use the affinity of the monstrosity for its own kind to reopen the breach in the Veil. That will be the end, Simon. Nothing can withstand the influx of chaos and destruction which will instantly take place.”
   “No — no — not that!” Vaughan almost choked with fear.
   Gaunt’s head sank between his narrow shoulders, and his fingers clawed. His voice was a menacing whisper.
   “Twice you have resisted me, Simon. I promised that a third time would be the last.”
   Vaughan cowered and finished his robing with shaking hands. When the leaden circlet was on his brow and he had taken up his wand he looked at Gaunt.
   “The unction?” he asked. Gaunt nodded briefly and, turning, strode towards the other trunk, which stood at some little distance. Vaughan watched him go with narrowed eyes, his noisy breathing suddenly hushed. The moment the doctor was beyond the outermost ring of the diagram upon the floor the other sprang, hurling his great body up the altar steps. Setting his back against the stone, he raised the rod in his left hand and uttered one word in an unknown tongue.
   Gaunt stopped in his tracks and slewed his head round, staring back over his shoulder. Slowly his body followed, then, his face twisting with anger, he started back towards his colleague. But he got no farther than the outer circle of the diagram, finding his progress barred by the same immaterial barrier which Hamilton and Lorrimer had once encountered. For a moment it seemed as if his rage would get the better of him, and he made one frantic effort to force his way through by sheer strength. But his self-control was too great for blind fury to master him, and he stepped back, folding his arms and glaring at the man who was defying him.
   “So,” he snarled, “rebellion! I might have known. Once a priest, always a priest. I should never have trusted you, Simon.”
   Vaughan made no reply, but continued to bend all the power of his will upon maintaining the invisible wall of force round the circle. Normally he knew that he could not have withstood the doctor’s will for a moment, but he himself had made this diagram, and, knowing how powerful it was, he relied utterly upon its protection. At the back of his mind was a tremendous feeling of astonishment at himself for having at last burnt his boats by defying his erstwhile master in this decisive fashion. He could hardly believe that he had, indeed, done so, and he could not imagine whence had come the sudden influx of courage which had prompted him. He wondered what Gaunt would do now, and watched with vague curiosity as the doctor went to the trunk, which had been his undoing, and began to rummage in its interior. With sudden horror he saw him straighten up, a curiously contrived apparatus in his hands.
   Gaunt turned the thing over speculatively. He had never used it before, and he was doubtful of its efficacy in this case, but if it operated as it should it would save him a great deal of trouble, and energy, which he wished to conserve for the great work he had to do at noon.
   The instrument was actually a‘blasting-rod’, similar to those used by the witches of old, and consisted of a hazel staff, symbolically carved, terminating in three prongs of iron, bound to it with copper wire. It resembled in appearance the top of a lightning conductor, though its purpose was the exact opposite of that humane contrivance.
   Holding it firmly in both hands, he leveled it at his mutinous colleague and began to speak the words of the appropriate ritual. Vaughan thrust all doubts and difficulties from his mind and concentrated his whole energy against this new threat.
   For some minutes there was absolute silence in the gloomy crypt, then a low humming sound began, proceeding from the rod itself, which simultaneously started to vibrate. Gaunt observed that a bluish glow was gathering about the prongs. This was as it should be, and with a smile of triumph he opened his lips again and spoke the last phrase of the ritual.
   Instantly a stream of livid fire leapt from the end of the rod, burst through the invisible barrier, and fell full upon the hapless Vaughan with a crash like a thunderclap. He gave one stricken cry and fell writhing to the ground. Gaunt walked quietly up to him and stood looking down curiously.
   “I am sorry, Simon,” he said calmly, “but you shouldn’t have tried to resist me. I warned you many times. On your own head be it!”
   The other gazed up at him, his face twisted with anguish, but a strange dignity in his eyes.
   “I have failed,” he muttered, “but at least I tried to stop you. You cannot go on with this, Gaunt. They will not allow you to.”
   Gaunt threw back his head and laughed aloud.
   “Let them try to stop me!” he cried, and, stepping over Vaughan, he lifted the altar-stone. In a moment he had climbed over the side and disappeared, leaving the dying man alone.
   Vaughan struggled feebly on to his knees and began to crawl up the altar steps. He managed to catch the edge of the front slab and tried desperately to drag himself to his feet, but his strength failed and he fell back, groaning.
   In a voice so low that, had there been any human ears to hear, they would scarce have caught the words, he murmured:
   “Have mercy, Jesu!” Then he sighed once and lay still. The unquiet spirit had passed beyond mortal judgment.
   II
   The launch chugged steadily on through the fog, which was so thick that none of the four occupants of the boat could see another, save as vague shadows in the gloom. The water was dead still and black as ink. Its very nature seemed to be subtly changed, for it did not foam in their wake, but surged sluggishly round the stern like thick oil.
   Tony crouched over the wheel, his face only a few inches from the illuminated compass by which he was endeavouring to steer a course. Hamilton sat beside Tony, glaring into the dazzling funnel of radiance thrown into the fog by the bow searchlight. He very much doubted if it would pick up an obstacle in time to avert a collision, but he was hoping for the best. Valerie and the rector sat together in the stern.
   When they had arrived at the harbour, some fifteen minutes before, they had found a small knot of villagers on the quay, gloomily regarding the wall of fog which shut off the sea. No attempt had been made either to help or hinder, and they had watched Hamilton and Tony drag the launch into the water without comment. Hamilton supposed that they were in the grip of the same deadly lethargy against which he himself was struggling so fiercely. Every movement was an effort. It seemed so much easier to stay still and just let things take their course. But, driven by their indomitable purpose, the four had at last got the boat afloat and climbed aboard.
   They had been immediately swallowed up by the fog, and had to feel their way out of the narrow harbour mouth with boat-hooks. Once they were in the open sea the rector had advised a compass course due north-west, which, he maintained, would leave them very close to Kestrel at the end of thirty minutes.
   Since then they had exchanged no more than a couple of words, sitting staring with smarting eyes into the incredible denseness of the ruddy cloud which covered them. Denser than any fog they had ever known it was— worse than London at its damnedest, as Hamilton had remarked grimly. It was not damp, as water vapour is, but dry and hot, burning the eyes and lungs, smelling sulphurous and bitter, like the smoke from a smouldering heap of pit refuse.
   The dead calm made navigation easier, but Tony doubted very much if they would get within a mile of the island. It was unlikely that the tide-race had ceased to run, and they would probably be swept miles out of their course. Nevertheless, he kept his eyes fixed to the compass, dimly seen beneath its hooded lamp, and each time the illuminated card swung to left or right he corrected the movement by a compensating deflection of the rudder.
   To Valerie, beside the silent figure of her uncle, it seemed that this dream-like voyage had lasted since the beginning of time and would continue through all eternity. Utterly isolated from the world, and from their own kind, they glided on through the endless, blood-red gloom. Tony’s dim figure at the helm might have been that of a modern Charon, piloting them over the black, fathomless waters of Lethe itself. Indeed, the girl found herself wondering if the catastrophe had come, unseen and unheralded, and they were, in fact, all dead and in another world. A great wearinessand desolation lay heavy on her soul. The boat crept on, its engine purring gently.
   Tony spoke abruptly, shattering the illusion.
   “We have missed it. We must be three miles out now.” His voice sounded muffled and hollow.
   The rector lifted his head. He had been praying silently, desperately almost. For the little gleam of light which had come to him at the Mass had died out, leaving him alone in the darkness.
   “We must not miss it, Tony,” he said simply. “Change your course and try again.”
   Tony spun the wheel to port and the boat swung round obediently. Keeping its head southwards now, he slowed the engine still more.
   Hamilton strained his eyes, peering in every direction, but there was nothing to be seen save the all-pervading mist.
   Five minutes passed without incident, then Tony put the launch about unprompted and steered due north. Hamilton looked anxiously at his watch; it was half past ten. Time was getting desperately short. The rector’s lips moved ceaselessly.
   All at once Valerie stiffened. Was it only imagination, or could she really hear the engine of another boat, somewhere away to the left? She called to Tony, and he cut out the motor. They drifted along silently, but there was no sound to be heard save their own quick breathing. Hamilton cupped his hands round his mouth and gave a hail. Almost immediately the echo was flung back. They were close under the cliffs of Kestrel, and, but for the girl’s sharp ears, would have passed it by unseen.
   Hope springing up in his heart, Tony started the engine and they crept cautiously in. A great shadow loomed up out of the obscurity, and Hamilton swung the searchlight, picking up the rocks, dangerously close.
   It was anxious work seeking the entrance to the harbour, but the fog seemed a little less dense close to the island, and they found it at last. Boat-hooks out, ready to fend off the rocky walls, they glided in. It was but a moment’s work to make fast and disembark, and together they climbed the stairway.
   The fog was left behind the moment they set foot on land, and as they mounted the island presented a fantastic spectacle. On every side great cliffs of vapour shut it in, and it lay, as it were, at the bottom of a vast pit of lurid light. The rocks appeared black as coal, and the Abbey made a picture of horrifying splendour, towering monstrously above them. The effort of climbing in the terrific heat was terribly exhausting, and by the time they reached the platform before the great gateway their clothes were wringing with sweat.
   After a moment’s pause to regain their breath they approached the gate, each with a nameless apprehension gnawing at his heart. Then they stopped dead and stood rooted in their tracks. Not only was the wicket in the great door shut, but some feet in front of it, barring every hope of entrance, the portcullis had been dropped.
   Speechless with dismay, they crowded forward and examined it. Constructed of massive iron bars, it must have weighed many tons, and the force of its fall had driven the pointed ends of the vertical bars deep into the ground.
   “No good,” said Hamilton at last. “We might have forced the door somehow, but that — never.”
   “I’ve never seen it down before,” Tony said. “It must be centuries since it was last used — the windlasses in the gatehouse are rusted solid — they will have cut the chains.” With a gesture of despair he turned away.
   “Is there no other way in?” asked the rector.
   “None,” Tony answered. “The outer wall is only pierced at this point.”
   Hamilton looked up at the top of the arch. It might be possible to climb the grating of the portcullis, but the wall of the gatehouse jutted out too far above it to permit further progress. He walked back a few paces and studied the great wall itself. It was fully thirty feet high, and though the granite blocks of which it was built had been much weathered by hundreds of years of wind and rain, they were too closely jointed to offer safe foothold. Moreover, the battlements overhung in such a way that it would have been impossible to negotiate them.
   “Is there a rope in the launch?” he asked.
   Tony followed the direction of his gaze, and his interest quickened.
   “The mooring-ropes would be too short,” said he, “but there is the anchor chain.”
   “Too heavy,” Hamilton decided. “We could never throw it up. Now, a light grappling-hook — if we had such a thing.”
   “But we have!” cried Tony. “In the boat-house. I’ve wondered what it was for many a time. I’ll get it; there may be a rope as well.” He set off down the steps at a run.
   The others said no word while he was gone, but in each heart hope was running high. At last he came back, panting, with a rusty iron grapnel in one hand and a coil of rope in the other.
   “Fine!” Hamilton greeted him, and quickly they made the hook fast to the rope. Hamilton whirled it round his head and let go. The iron clattered against the wall, some feet from the top, and fell back. Again he tried, and yet again, and at the third throw caught the parapet.
   Kicking off his shoes and digging his toes into the crevices of the wall, he began to climb hand over hand up the rope. Breathlessly they watched him, Valerie clinging nervously to Tony’s sleeve, her face white.
   Hamilton had reached the top and was negotiating the overhanging battlement when the rope, rotten with age and frayed against the edge of the stone, broke, leaving him hanging by his hands. Tony swore under his breath, and the girl hid her face in his coat. But Hamilton did not fall. In perfect physical condition, he was able to draw himself up by sheer strength of arm and in a few seconds stood safely on the broad parapet. He looked down at their white faces and grinned cheerfully.
   “Acrobatic performance number one!” he remarked. “Now, Tony, have a look at that rope.”
   Obediently Tony went to the foot of the wall and picked up the fallen coil. He ran it through his hands and shook his head. It had stretched badly and several strands were broken. It would be madness to trust to it again.
   “All right,” said Hamilton, when this intelligence was conveyed to him. “I’ll go down and see what I can find. If I see another rope I’ll come back and haul you up; if not — well, I’ll carry on and see what I can do alone.”
   Feverishly they tried to persuade him not to venture into the Abbey unaccompanied, but for answer he flourished his pistol in the air and disappeared behind the parapet.
   “He’ll not come back,” said Tony; “the dear fool means to go through with it by himself.”
   They looked helplessly at one another.
   “We must do something, Tony,” exclaimed Valerie.
   The young man cast out his hands in a gesture of despair.
   “What can we do?” he demanded.
   The rector spoke.
   “I don’t think we should worry overmuch about his safety. He may be the chosen one, you know. But at the same time I do not think we should stay here and make no effort to help. You are quite certain, Tony, that there is absolutely no other way in? No secret entrance or anything of that sort?”
   Tony stared. Like a flash the memory of his visit to the caves with his two former associates came back to him.
   “Yes!” he cried. “Why didn’t I think of it before? Thereis another way. Down on the other side of the island— a cave leading up into the crypt.”
   “The crypt,” echoed Valerie; “he will be there. Come quickly.”
   There was need for haste, for as they piled into the launch the hands of Tony’s watch stood at five minutes past eleven.
   The voyage round the island was a hair-raising experience, and time after time they avoided the razor-edged rocks by inches. They dared not venture far from the cliffs into the denser fog lest they lose the island altogether.
   Eventually they reached the sheer cliff on the western side, and by the merest stroke of luck found the entrance to the cave almost at once. Tony made the boat fast to a projecting knob of rock and drew himself up the four or five feet into the yawning mouth of the cavern. He then lay down and, stretching out his arms, helped first Valerie and then the rector. The calmness of the sea made the task less hazardous, and presently all three were walking over the sandy floor into the innermost recesses of the cave. Tony had taken a torch from the locker of the boat, and after a little searching found the crevice which led into the low tunnel beyond.
   Bending double, they crawled along. The air was stifling, and the very rock felt warm to the touch. Soon they found the way barred by the iron-bound door. This was fastened on the inside, so Tony picked up a piece of fallen rock and battered a hole in the ancient, decaying wood, through which he was able to reach the bar.
   As they passed through the torrid heat was exchanged for cold so intense that their sweat-damp clothes clung clammily to their shivering bodies. There was a vile smell in the air, and wreaths of yellowish vapour hung in the beam of the torch. The sense of some monstrous spiritual evil close at hand was so great that the rector crossed himself involuntarily, and Valerie clung, half fainting, to her lover. The rest of the journey through the passages was a nightmare to her, at least, for her mind was full of the memory of her dreadful experience in this same spot.
   The rector and Tony did not spare her, but hurried forward, one on either side, almost dragging her along. They hardly noticed her distress, so oppressed were they by the double anxiety for their comrade Hamilton and for the whole world, which every second brought nearer to inconceivable disaster.
   At the triple fork Tony, who by some odd trick of the memory had overlooked the significance of the great cavern, led them straight on without a pause. Soon they were climbing the steps up to the crypt.
   Chapter XXI
   I
   Hamilton hurried down the stairway in the gatehouse turret, shutting his ears to the shouts of his friends. As Tony had surmised, he had no intention whatever of attempting to get them over the wall; the broken rope had been an admirable excuse. His motives in undertaking this forlorn hope by himself were twofold. In the first place he desperately wanted to shield both Valerie and Tony, since she loved him, or seemed to, from all harm. If anyone had to be hurt he would far rather it were he, even if death should be his reward. And secondly, in spite of everything, he still thought that the others rated Gaunt’s powers too high. He wanted to prove to his own satisfaction that the man was but mortal after all, and would prove as amenable to force as anyone else.
   Sprinting across the courtyard, he cocked his pistol, and the tiny click of the bolt sent a furious joy flooding through his veins. Let Gaunt give him but half a chance and he would see who was the stronger.
   The doors were all locked and the ground-floor windows shuttered, but he had anticipated this and laid his plans accordingly. One of those precious bullets was sufficient to shatter the fastening of the shutter on one of the kitchen windows, and the butt of the pistol did the rest. The noise seemed shockingly loud in the silence, and Hamilton stood waiting for several minutes before climbing in, but nothing stirred.
   He found the cool interior a welcome change from the oppressive heat outside, and lit a cigarette before proceeding farther. He surveyed the disorder of the kitchen with a disdainful smile. Why, the two alleged wizards had lived like pigs, and very human pigs at that!
   The ashes on the hearth were still smoking, and the glass of the table-lamp was warm. They could not have been gone long. He set off along the corridor to the great hall.
   Until now he had noticed nothing unusual in the atmosphere of the place, perhaps because he was full of disdain and self-confidence, but with each step he took towards the crypt he felt his courage draining away. This place was not as it should be. The loaded gun simile, which had occurred to him before, now came back with redoubled force. But this was no gun, he thought; it was a powder-mine, and the train was already lit— he could almost see the fatal spark creeping along the fuse.
   He entered the great hall and made for the open trap. Then he stopped short, his heart hammering in his throat. He could have sworn that something had moved in the yawning hole. No, there was nothing. He took another step. Yes, there was! He blinked, and it was gone. Then, as he watched, it came again, a thin coil of yellow vapour drifting up out of the depths.
   H’m, more devilry, he supposed, but nothing very substantial. He looked sharply round. Was that a mocking chuckle he had heard in the shadows? God! The very shadows were moving, creeping up behind him!
   He told himself that he was being foolish, but he would have given worlds for a light, as with faltering steps he went on to the trap.
   He did not turn his head again, but forced himself to descend into the thick darkness, yet the last memory he bore with him of the great hall of Kestrel was of a place full of mocking whispers and creeping shadows that crowded after him.
   The descent down that long spiral was an experience that Hamilton did not care to think about afterwards. More than once he felt something cold and damp brush across his face— he hoped it was a cobweb, but he feared it was not. Once he despaired of ever reaching the bottom — there was that true nightmare quality about it — but after what seemed an eternity he came down into the crypt.
   It was lit, ever so faintly, with a pale light which came from somewhere in the midst of the wilderness of pillars, and he made for the radiance like a benighted traveler lost in a forest.
   The light was a vapour-lamp hissing away beside the open altar. Near by lay the misshapen body of Simon Vaughan. There was a scorched smell about his clothing, and looking closer Hamilton saw the burns upon his face.
   Wondering vaguely what had happened, he looked round, and his eye fell upon something which drove all speculation upon the dead Satanist out of his mind: an electric torch lying on the altar steps. He seized it thankfully and switched on the powerful beam. With this in one hand and his gun in the other he felt more of a match for creeping shadows!
   There was no sign of Gaunt, but the open altar told its own story, and Hamilton remembered Tony’s description of the great cave where the curse-monstrosity dwelt. Hoping he would be able to find his way through the labyrinth, he scrambled over the altar-side and went down the steps.
   Then began a bitter struggle, for no sooner had he started along the tunnel than the same feeling he had encountered with Lorrimer in the crypt above swept over him. A crushing horror that turned his limbs to water and his heart to ice; a great despair, as an inward voice whispered continually:“It’s no use going on. You can’t stop him — nothing can. The game is lost.”
   And out of the darkness ahead crept great coils of thick yellow vapour, seeming actually to impede Hamilton’s progress as they writhed serpent-like about his feet and crawled clammily over his face.
   Almost vomiting with disgust and terror, he beat frantically at them with his arms and broke into a shambling run. Had he not done so he must have either sunk down helpless or turned and fled. It speaks volumes for the sheer grit of the man that he ever reached the division of the passage, but reach it he did, and recalling Tony’s description took the left-hand tunnel.
   From that moment the attack lessened, and he went on unhindered, but with growing conviction in his mind that he was going to fail. He could sense the frightful power which awaited him, and he went to meet it with no hope of victory but simply because it was the only thing to do. He could not have turned back now and faced the crawling mist again, so on he went, with his pitifully inadequate weapons clutched tightly in his hands.
   At the turn of the passage he stepped into a blaze of greenish light, and there, facing him on the narrow platform above the great cave, his arms folded, stood Nicholas Gaunt.
   Hamilton stopped. The doctor smiled sardonically.
   “Good morning, Mr. Hamilton,” he announced. “We meet again. I have watched your progress with interest. May I compliment you upon your courage? Few men could have passed my sentinels and kept their reason. Now that you are here you will have the opportunity of witnessing a most interesting experiment. Please step forward.”
   The mocking voice was more than Hamilton could endure. Blind rage sweeping through him, he lifted his pistol and pressed the trigger.
   But the hammer never fell. Instead, a violent shock ran through Hamilton’s arm and the weapon fell with a clatter to the rock.
   “You are a very rash young man,” remarked Gaunt. “I doubt if the bullet would have harmed me, but I think it best not to take any risks just now. Come here, and let us have no more foolery.”
   Like a man in a dream Hamilton felt his legs move automatically, carrying him to the spot at which the doctor’s long forefinger was pointing. He struggled frantically to stand still, to disobey, but he was helpless in the grip of that awful will.
   A circle had been carefully drawn on the rocky platform with some white substance, and when he was inside this Hamilton came to a standstill. The doctor nodded approvingly.
   “That’s better,” he said. “You will not move again.”
   Instantly Hamilton felt as if he were encased in iron bands. He could not stir so much as a finger, though the sweat broke out all over him with the effort. Dumbly he watched the Satanist continue his interrupted preparations.
   Round the edge of the circle he was placing seven bronze lamps. When he had them arranged to his satisfaction he lit them and then proceeded to ignite the charcoal in a brazier which stood in the middle. He took up his wand and laid it across the glowing coals. Finally he drew out his watch and consulted it.
   “Eleven-fifty-five,” he said. “Time to being. I trust we shall have no more interruptions.”
   II
   The first thing that met the eyes of Tony and his two companions as they emerged cautiously into the crypt was the lifeless body of Simon Vaughan. A quick glance around satisfied them that there was no one else about, and they stood bewildered, looking down at the dead man.
   In spite of the terrible burns they could see that his features were as calmly set as if he were asleep, and on his lips there was the faintest hint of a smile.
   Valerie caught her breath. She felt the strangest impulse to weep over this man, who in his life had stood in her mind for all the filthy wickedness of the world. Surely that pale, serene face, purged by death of all its grossness, could not be that of the monstrous Satanist she had known and hated.
   The rector knelt beside the body. He too was conscious of some great mystery here.
   “How did he die, I wonder,” he mused. “Not John, surely.”
   “No,” said Tony, “never. Look at his clothes, his face — all burnt. He looks like a poor wretch I once saw struck by lightning. And there is but one man on Kestrel who could command the lightning. He must have resisted Gaunt, as I hoped and prayed he would, and, so doing, was destroyed. Poor fellow, he cannot have been wholly bad.”
   “He was a priest,” the rector reminded them, “and that very fact made his sins infinitely more grievous, but at the same time it may have made it easier for him to turn back. If he repented, even with his last conscious thought, who knows but that the Infinite Mercy may not enfold him yet? Weshall never know the truth, but I think we may, in all charity, pray for his soul.”
   Impelled by a deep urge, which came he knew not whence, he took the crucifix from his own girdle and laid it upon the dead man’s breast, folding the stiff, cold hands over it. “Into Thy Hands, O God!” he murmured, and stood up.
   Tony flashed the beam of his torch round on the floor and noticed, all at once, the blasting-rod lying where Gaunt had dropped it. With a muttered exclamation he started forward and picked it up.
   “What is it, Tony?” asked Valerie fearfully.
   In a low voice he told them.
   “So we were right,” said the rector when he had finished. “Vaughan resisted Gaunt and was destroyed. And then — what did Gaunt do? Where is he now?”
   Tony frowned.
   “The altar was open when we came up,” he mused. “I wonder if…? Yes, of course, he must be! God! What a fool I am! The great cave, the lair of the curse, that’s where he’ll be — not here!”
   Quickly they climbed back into the altar and hurried down the steps. They had hardly reached the bottom when the rock underfoot began to tremble and from the darkness of the tunnel came a hollow rumbling sound. The three stopped, clinging together.
   “Too late,” Tony whispered in a voice heavy with despair — “he has begun.” He looked at his watch. The hands stood dead on twelve. With a half-sob he turned away and leaned against the wall.
   The rector spoke sharply:
   “Tony, I absolutely forbid you to give in. Come, it may still be possible to stop him. John may be there.”
   “If he is he can’t do anything — no one can. We’re finished, I tell you.”
   Valerie timidly laid her hand on his arm.
   “Tony dear,” she whispered, “for my sake, for all our sakes, don’t be like this. Let’s go through with it together.”
   He looked at her wonderingly.
   “Very well, my darling, if you wish. But it’s not earthly use.”
   So they went on together. There was no opposition such as Hamilton had met with, only the steadily growing oppression of a power of darkness so terrific that their very souls sickened. With each step they took the vibration of the rock grew more violent, until they were hard put to it to keep their feet. The cold grew deadly, until every breath was an effort, cutting the lungs like a knife.
   As they drew near the end of the passage the increasing radiance from in front made Tony’s torch unnecessary, and he switched it off, thrusting it in his pocket. They turned the corner and came to an abrupt halt.
   On the ledge, silhouetted against the ghastly greenish glare, were two figures: John Hamilton, erect and motionless, and Nicholas Gaunt.
   The latter, a bizarre picture in his ceremonial robes, was pacing slowly round the brazier, whispering softly. He stopped the moment the three appeared in the mouth of the tunnel and gazed at them incredulously, his eyes blazing with fury. He raised one hand, and Tony, at least expected to be destroyed instantly, but the doctor seemed to hesitate, and finally beckoned to them, saying:
   “Come, my friends, and join your comrade. You are just in time to see the end.”
   They made no effort to resist his will, but walked quietly forward and stood beside Hamilton, within the circle. Their friend looked at them, and though his eyes spoke volumes his lips did not move.
   “You must forgive your companion’s seeming discourtesy,” said Gaunt suavely, “but I have had to place him under restraint. He was inclined to be violent when he arrived, and violence I abhor.”
   Valerie gasped.
   “You’ve not hurt him, have you?” she demanded.
   Gaunt shook his head.
   “No, I have not hurt him — yet. I would destroy you all, without the least compunction, but it would entail an expenditure of power which I can ill afford at present. Later you will all go together.”
   “Dr. Gaunt,” said the rector quietly, “if you value your soul you will stop this infernal game of yours before it is too late.”
   Gaunt laughed: an ugly sound.
   “Itis too late,” he said, “the wheels of destiny are turning, and nothing can stop them now.”
   At this point Tony, who had been carrying the blasting-rod ever since he had found it in the crypt, swung the heavy thing clubwise over his head, but the doctor was too quick for him. One backward leap took him out of range, and like the crack of a whip his voice rang out:
   “Stop! You cannot move!”
   Paralyzed, Tony remained as he was, one arm in the air. Gaunt quietly took the rod from his helpless fingers and threw it out of the circle.
   “Now be still and silent, all of you. I cannot concentrate in the midst of such commotion.”
   His tone was quite commonplace, but upon each of his hearers descended the same invisible bonds of silence and immobility which bound Hamilton. Rooted to the rock, they stood and watched.
   Going to the extreme edge of the circle, where it verged upon the brink of the platform, Gaunt fixed his eyes on a point in the centre of the cavern floor, far below, and began to move his lips soundlessly. The rumbling sound which had been going on faintly all the while like distant thunder now grew louder and more near, and the shuddering of the rock became a steady pulse. The green light flooding the place waxed and waned, seeming to vibrate in sympathy.
   Suddenly a great circular expanse of rock in the middle of the floor below bulged violently upwards. For an instant it quivered there like a gigantic bubble, then it broke, and in the pit beneath writhed the black slime of corruption which was the substance of the curse-monstrosity. The very air seemed to darken as the horror came into view, and the essence of concentrated evil rose from it in waves so overpowering that the senses of Gaunt’s helpless companions reeled.
   The doctor smiled with quiet satisfaction and turned towards them.
   “There it lies, my friends,” he said — “the so-called curse of the Lovells — mine now to do with as I will. As I suppose you know, I had intended to set it free and let it spread over the whole world, but your presence here has made that undesirable. Be not too thankful until I have done!I hope to do a much greater thing than that.
   “Long ages ago the greatest magician, perhaps, this world has ever known dwelt here, and conducted his magical experiments in this very cavern. Here, at this same hour, he succeeded in doing a thing no man had ever done before: he made a breach in the Veil which hangs between this creation and the Outer Chaos. For but an instant of Time the Veil was rent, and through the breach came this monstrosity. The Magus bound it to this rock and went away — none knows whither — leaving his experiment half done. Ages after came the monks, and by reason of their exceeding holiness dwelt here unharmed by that which lay dormant beneath their feet. Then came the first of the Lovells, committing sacrilege; the creature woke, and the Abbot’s words, by vague intention, and by one chance phrase, completed a phase of the ancient ritual; and it fastened itself upon the house of Lovell, battening upon their very life, until at last Tony Lovell cut the bond which bound it to himself and gave the reins to me.
   “But it grows weary of its exile here: it longs for its own kind. The hour is ripe for me to do once more the thing that Great One did so long ago. Something of his wisdom lives in me, and through the strength and blind ferocity of that dark monster, yearning for its kind, I shall rend once more the Veil, and open wide the breach between this world and Chaos. But this time it shall not be shut, but shall stand open for eternity, letting the Outer Darkness in upon the world.”
   Speechless, immobile, his hearers never doubted that Gaunt had the power to carry out his monstrous threat. So bruised were their minds by the accumulation of things seemingly impossible that they had well-nigh lost the power of reasoned thought: they could only listen stupefied to his vaunting monologue.
   “Humanity has looked its last upon the sun,” he went on remorselessly, “for soon the sun will be blotted out for ever: sun, moon, stars; the green earth; all beauty and all loveliness; for these things have absolute existence only in the mind of man, and when the Veil is rent again, and this earth becomes a playground for the horrors of the Dark, mankind will be plunged into the Abyss and utterly destroyed. Even God Himself will cease to be.”
   So dreadful was the expression of hellish glee upon the face of the Satanist as he uttered the last words that the rector closed his eyes to shut out the abominable sight.
   Gaunt’s lips curled as he saw this.
   “Pray, priest, pray!” he sneered. “You did not think your God could be destroyed, did you? Well, know now that He can, at least, to the knowledge of this creation. He will not answer your prayers: He is powerless before the might of my Lord. O Satan, Master! I thank Thee for this hour!”
   “O God,” the rector prayed passionately in his heart, “strike this blasphemer dead!”
   But the prayer went up unanswered, and Gaunt turned away from them, and stood for a while contemplating the writhing horror below. Under his steady gaze its movements became less and less violent, until it lay almost quiescent save for a slight rhythmical swell upon its surface. Once he moved his hands in a peculiar manner, and a sympathetic shudder ran through its slimy substance. Satisfied that he had it completely under control, he went to the brazier and cast a handful of powder into it. A dense white smoke sprang up, and hung in a thick pall overhead. Then, taking up his glowing wand, he began to recite the words and perform the actions of a ritual which even the highest of adepts have thought to be lost in the mists of antiquity.
   Fascinated like rabbits before a snake, the four watched helplessly. They heard the rumbling sound which filled the cavern die away, until there was silence save for the low chanting of the Satanist. They felt the vibration of the rock lessen and cease. At last even Time itself seemed to stand still, as Gaunt stretched his still-glowing wand downwards towards the monstrosity.
   Then— how can mere words describe what followed? It seemed that the thing heaved its monstrous bulk out of the pit in the cavern floor and hurled itself at the foot of the opposite wall. But was it merely the opposite wall? Did, then, the wall of that cavern, great at it was, stretch out on every side into immensity? Was it smooth as glass and softly shining? They realized that this was no mere cavern wall but the substance of the Veil itself, rendered visible by the magician in their midst. Past terror now, almost curiously they watched, as the monstrosity, obedient to Gaunt’s direction, began to attack that unbelievable barrier.
   The doctor stood rigid, every particle of his terrific will concentrated upon his task, the sweat pouring from his face. They could feel the dark power radiating from that tall figure, and the crimson aura about him was clearly visible. Tension piled on tension as the long minutes crept into eternity. The silence was absolute: a tangible thing.
   Then, with a sound like the crack of doom, the Veil was rent. From the creature tearing at its foot a jagged rift starred out across the wall. A shrill cry of triumph burst from Gaunt’s lips, and the monstrosity began thrusting itself into the aperture. Nor was that all, for, as it strove to widen the breach, it began to utter a deep bellowing call, which was immediately answered, at first as from a great distance and then close at hand, as the horrified watchers beheld vague, monstrous shapes of Darkness crowding to meet it beyond the Veil.
   Even in that awful moment the rector was praying continually, crying out in the darkness of his mind to the God he knew to be all-powerful.
   “O God, let not Thy people perish! Let them not be destroyed utterly! From everlasting damnation deliver us, O Lord!”
   He fixed his eyes upon the Satanist, confidently expecting the fire from Heaven which must soon fall upon him. But that was not God’s way.
   Tony was past framing a conscious prayer, but he let his mind sink into the infinite in the way he had been taught. With no thought of self, his soul reached out until he knew he was on the threshold of the Presence. There he made an offering of himself for all mankind, very humbly.
   The rift in the Veil was now of an appalling width. Only one thing prevented the immediate entry of the Darkness, and that was the monstrosity itself, still thrusting through the gap impelled by Gaunt’s command and its own furious desire to rejoin its kind. In another moment it would be through, and the Darkness would come flooding irresistibly in, blasting the world for ever.
   Then God came: august, inexorable, unhurried. Not with the lightning and thunder of Sinai; not with the flames of Pentecost; but unseen, unheralded, in the quiet certainty of omnipotence.
   Through Tony Lovell’s hands and feet and side shot a fiery dart of agony; and at the same instant the invisible shackles which Gaunt’s will had bound about his limbs were loosed and he was free. Without the slightest hesitation, though he knew he was going to almost certain death, he flung himself upon the Satanist. Caught unawares, Gaunt lost his balance, and for one age-long moment the two tottered on the brink of the ledge, locked in mortal combat; then they had fallen headlong into the gulf.
   Still powerless to stir an inch, the three who were left saw with agonized eyes the two bodies, still clinging together, strike the cavern floor, only a few yards from the pit whence the monstrosity had come. That both were not killed instantly was in itself miraculous, but Gaunt, who had fallen undermost, was on his feet almost as soon as Tony. He had received injuries which must have incapacitated an ordinary man, and it was only by the exercise of his whole will that he kept the life in his broken body. What he saw to terrify him in the figure of the chalk-faced, blood-bespattered young man who staggered towards him no one will ever know; but with the cry of a hunted beast he turned and fled round the lip of the pit, with Tony after him. And the monstrosity, lying motionless, half through the Veil, watched him come. Not until he was almost upon it did he realize his frightful predicament: then it was too late. He could spare not the least fraction of will-power to ward off the horror as it surged towards him, catching his feet. He uttered one scream of mortal anguish and fell forwards into the bubbling mass. For an instant his white robe fluttered against the blackness, then he was gone, and the whole bulk of the monstrosity heaved itself out through the gap, taking its erstwhile master with it.
   Immediately the bonds which held the watchers on the ledge were broken. Valerie reeled and would have fallen had Hamilton not caught her. Clinging together, they beheld the last act in that incredible drama.
   When he saw Gaunt’s dreadful end Tony had stopped, one hand pressed against his bleeding side; but now, despite injuries which made each step an agony, he went resolutely on until he was before the rift in the Veil. His friends saw him pause for a moment as if undecided what to do, expecting each second the dark clouds of chaos and dissolution which swirled beyond the breach to pour in and overwhelm him. Then he straightened himself and spread wide his arms. As the radiance about him grew stronger the rector saw for the first time his bleeding hands, and his dark footprints on the rocky floor. Understandingthe great glory which had come upon Tony Lovell, he made the sign of the Cross and watched with reverent eyes, knowing now that there was nothing more to fear.
   The slight figure with the outspread arms, which stood alone between the world and destruction, uttered seven words in a clear, ringing voice. To his mortal hearers they meant nothing save music which seemed not of this earth; but the Guardians of the Veil heard and understood. With a mighty clashing sound, like that of iron gates swinging together, the breach was closed. Then the vision of the Veil faded, leaving only the rocky cavern wall, rough but unbroken as before. At the same moment the unearthly light which flooded the place dimmed and passed, leaving them in darkness, save for the flickering lamps and the dimly glowing brazier.
   Hamilton sought and found his torch, lying where he had dropped it in the mouth of the tunnel. Cautiously they descended to the floor of the cavern, and, skirting the empty pit, came to the place where Tony was.
   At first they thought him to be dead already, so still he lay; but when Hamilton had pillowed the bruised head on his coat he opened his eyes and smiled weakly up at them.
   “All clear, John?” he asked.
   “All clear, Tony, thanks to you.”
   “Not thanks to me, John. Something came over me, and I was set free from his power. I had to do it then. Perhaps God chose me as His agent after all.”
   “He did, my son,” the rector whispered. “Look at your hands.”
   Wonderingly, Tony lifted them and saw the Stigmata.
   “Lord, I am not worthy,” he murmured, but the glory in his face belied the words.
   For some minutes there was silence save for the quiet weeping of Valerie, who knelt beside him. Presently he touched her dark curls, saying:
   “Don’t cry, my darling. It’s better so — far better. I’ve squared the reckoning now, and everything is all right. You never loved me, did you? Not as you loved John. It was selfish of me to ask you to. Please forgive me. Be good to her, John.”
   Hamilton caught his arm and pressed it gently, unashamed of the tears which ran down his face. Tony spoke again, in a voice so low that they had to bend close to hear the words:
   “Valerie, won’t you smile for me?”
   She lifted her lovely face, struggling bravely with her tears, and gave him such a pitiful little smile that Hamilton thought his heart would surely break.
   “That’s better, my darling. Now one kiss. You don’t mind, John?”
   Hamilton shook his head and turned away; he could not speak.
   “Good-bye, my sweet,” Tony murmured, as she lifted her lips from his; then his eyes darkened, and his head fell back. So passed the last of the Lovells.
   The rector stood up, crossing himself.
   “Come, my children,” he said, “we must get out of here at once. The material fabric of this place has been tried too far, and with the monstrosity withdrawn I doubt if it will stand much longer.”
   “And leave him here?” Hamilton asked.
   “Why not? His soul is far away. Should not his body lie in the home of his fathers? It is not an abode of Darkness any more.”
   Even as he spoke there was a rending sound from above, and a great mass of rock fell from the roof, splintering not many yards from where they stood.
   So they made their way back up the tortuous pathway to the ledge and along the winding tunnel to the sea-cave. Every few minutes a hollow, echoing crash resounded behind them, and when at last they reached the sea the air in the tunnel was full of a fine dust of pulverized rock.
   They found the boat moored where they had left it, clambered in, and cast off at once. The sea was calm, but the fog had gone from the face of the waters and a fresh breeze was springing up. Hamilton took the wheel and steered for Pentock, while the rector sat in the stern holding Valerie in his arms. The girl was utterly worn out by all that she had gone through and lay quite still, her dark head pillowed on her uncle’s shoulder.
   They had put perhaps half a mile of blue water between them and the island when some indefinable impulse caused Hamilton to stop the engine and look back. Wondering, his companions followed his gaze, and for some minutes they sat there in the gently rocking boat looking at the once familiar but now strangely different scene.
   All was as it had ever been: the dark mass of the island crowned with the grey walls of the Abbey, merging imperceptibly into steep cliffs beneath; but there was no menace in it now, no veiled threat to mar its austere beauty. Instead, a kind of tragic loveliness, such as must for ever lie upon the hill of Calvary, now wrung the hearts of the three who looked at it. In this place also a young man had given himself for the world, greatly loving and greatly loved. Gone too was that air of immemorial strength which once had hung about the battlements; instead, a hint of unreality— a touch of the mirage — wove itself into the picture.
   Then, even as they watched, the mirage began to fade. Clear across the water came a curious grinding sound, and the massive right-hand tower of the Abbey crumpled inwards, vanishing in a spurt of flying rubble; the roar of its fall followed almost instantly. Quite slowly the second tower leaned across the main body of the building, disintegrating as it fell, until only the outer wall was left, while a great cloud of dust, belching from the ruins within, spread out across the sky. The dissolution of centuries, hitherto held in check by the indwelling power of the curse-monstrosity, was accomplished in the space of a few minutes. Hamilton made as if to speak, but the rector silenced him with a gesture; the end was not yet.
   The dust darkened the sky and made it difficult to see clearly what was happening, but it seemed that now the whole crest of the island was caving in. Hamilton realized that the roof of the great cavern within must have given way, for the island seemed to be swallowing the ruins of the Abbey bodily, until at length the rock was naked as when the sea first thrust it up, only a gaping chasm remaining to tell the tale of what had been. But even now outraged Nature was not satisfied, for a long gash opened in the face of the cliff nearest to them, and a vast mass of rock detached itself and slid into the sea with a mighty splash. The whole island appeared to shudder and tilt slightly, like an iceberg about to turn turtle, and then, with a gargantuan convulsion, sank into the depths. The waters rushed roaring together into the gulf where it had been, met, and spouted skywards in a column of foam many hundreds of feet into the air.
   As he saw the resultant wave rushing towards them Hamilton hurriedly started the engine and turned the launch bow-on to meet it. They were tossed up like a cockle-shell, and for some minutes were fully occupied in clinging to their seats. When at last, drenched with spray, they could lift their heads again, the sea was empty to the horizon. It was as if Kestrel had never been.finis
   DISCUSSING DARK SANCTUARY
   (An Interview with H.B. Gregory)
   JP: I and the readers of Inhuman are very appreciative of your taking the time for this interview. I know that I was floored to hear from your daughter some weeks ago, as all our attempts to locate you or an estate ran into a dead end. While my surprise was extreme, I can’t imagine what your reaction would have been to find that your novel was in print after all these years from some tiny company in the US. Could you tell us about your reaction to the news?
   HBG: I was amazed, but extremely gratified to learn of the resurrection ofDark Sanctuary; but sad that it came so late in my life when my late wife (to whom it was dedicated) and most of my old friends were gone. As a practicing Anglo-Catholic I hope it may strike a blow for Christianity in these faithless days.
   JP: Dark Sanctuary is certainly a classic tale of the struggle of good versus evil, but seems to share much in the way of atmosphere with the work of American writer H.P. Lovecraft. Had you read Lovecraft?
   HBG: I certainly had read Lovecraft and greatly acknowledge his influence, particularly in the Cthulhu Mythos, but I always found his failure to describe his nameless subterranean horrors irritating. So I described mine in full detail!
   JP: Who were some of your favorites in the horror/mystery genre?
   HBG: Charles Williams—War in Heaven, ThePlace of the Lion. Many C.S. Lewis—That Hideous Strength, Voyage to Venus, etc. Dennis Wheatley—The Devil Ride Out, Bram Stoker’sDracula, Stephen King’sSalem’s Lot. Peter Straub, Dean Koontz.
   JP: Your daughter mentioned to me that your writing really started off with the composition of plays for your Church theatre? Was the genesis ofDark Sanctuary a play?
   HBG: Yes. The idea of the family curse as a monster lurking in the crypt was there, but in the play this turned out to be a thief in an old diving suit seeking treasure. But the Abbot’s Curse was there and the Satanist “Gaunt”, (I played both parts myself!)
   JP: Dark Sanctuary is based on a real place that you visited on your honeymoon, could you tell us a bit about that?
   HBG: The island of“Kestrel” is based on St. Michael’s Mount, off the Cornish coast near Penzance. My wife and I spent our honeymoon nearby and visited the castle there; then the ancestral home of Lord St. Leven. Rider was worried about this and I had to write to his Lordship and submit the ms. For his approvalbefore they would publish. Happily, his Lordship approved and raised no objection to publication. He pointed out that since the island and abbey sank beneath the waves in my book, it could hardly be identified with his stately house, which is still there (accessible by a causeway at low tide) and awell-known tourist resort.
   JP: Could you tell us anything about the sale ofDark Sanctuary to Rider? Had you tried a number of other houses, or did it just seem that Rider was a good fit for a book of this type?
   HBG: I wrote the novel, for entry in a newspaper competition (which it didn’t win) and then sent the ms. to Hutchinson, who passed it over to Rider (still in their imprint today) and Rider published it in 1940 with 400 copies in the first and only edition. World War II had just begun and the book was a victim. It was well-received, but failed to sell. I suppose that some returning G.I. must have brought a copy to the US. Rider is still part of the Hutchinson’s group and I tried to interest them in republishing Dark Sanctuary many years ago, but they were not interested. In 1940 they mainly published fiction of (they said) the “quaint, queer, scarce, and rare type.” That would almost fit your lot today!
   JP: Interesting comparison, (and a flattering one)! Your publisher (Rider) and their parent company (Hutchinson) published a pretty wide range of books that revolved around horror and metaphysical themes, such as J.M. Mills’ two novelsThe Lords of the Earth andTomb of the Dark Ones; as well asBridge Over Dark Gods by Furze Morrish. Did you have any correspondence with other authors working for Rider?
   HBG: No. I didn’t know what else Rider had published. I sent ‘Dark Sanctuary’ to Hutchinson, who passed it on to Rider. They then wrote to me and said they would publish.
   JP: Considering the scarcity ofDark Sanctuary in first edition (I know of three copies in private hands, and one of them is yours); it’s not likely most of the readers of Inhuman will ever see a copy, let alone one with the dustjacket. Could you tell us what the jacket was like? Are we missing a great piece of artwork?
   HBG: It was similar to the current dustjacket: an impression of the abbey and a horrified face. It wasn’t very good, and in retrospect, the publishers thought it could have been improved.
   JP: Rider was pretty well-known for publishing a good deal of theosophist nonsense and seemingly published interesting fiction rather by accident than design. Were you surprised that the publishers of such silliness asA Message from the Sphinx andThe Projection of the Astral Body were interested in a novel written from a strongly Christian perspective?
   HBG: I would have been if I’d known. You seem to be assuming that, in those days, you selected a suitable publisher. You simply sent it off to various publishers until one accepted it. Nowadays, you have agents to do that sort of thing.
   JP: You mentioned your fondness for Lovecraft’s work previously and one of the most remarkable features of your novel is the Lovecraftian tone. However, you manage to work in two unique twists; First, you show us the horror in detail (which you mentioned was intentional). Possibly an even more important divergence was where Lovecraft postulates an atheist’s cosmology of chaos, where his Mythos deities are neither good nor evil, but simply completely indifferent; your book paints the eternal struggle in very clear shades of black and white and is equally effective. Was this counterpoint to Lovecraft also intentional?
   HBG: You are attributing a greater influence on me from Lovecraft than there was. Lovecraft was one of many authors I read, such as M R James, Dennis Wheatley and Charles Williams. I was not particularly concerned with Lovecraft’s mythology. I feel that there may have been less philosophical significance in both our works than you suggest. Starting from a Christian perspective, I invented a mythology in which the powers of darkness threatened the omnipotence of God. However, it was only the means by which God would assert this omnipotence which remained to be revealed (in the book).
   JP: While no one can question the effectiveness of showing the horror inDark Sanctuary, do you feel that much modern horror has become too descriptive and abandoned the writer’s strongest tool, that of the reader’s imagination?
   HBG: I suppose you might say that, but I feel it isn’t what the author wants; it’s what he thinks his public want.
   JP: Could you tell us a little bit about your foray into science fiction in the 1950s?
   HBG: I felt that I had exhausted my capacity for horror by writingDark Sanctuary. I wrote a short story called“Boy on the Moon”, which I offered to Boys Own Paper (a ‘serious’ text-based magazine for boys, containing stories and articles about science, hobbies etc.) The editor, concerned about scientific accuracy, submitted it to Patrick Moore (a famous British astronomer), who approved it, and they published.
   This success prompted me to write three or four sequels, which attracted the attention of Frank Wells (son of H G); at that time director of the‘Children’s Film Foundation’. They produced a serial, based on the stories, for showing in cinemas at children’s Saturday matinees.
   JP: Lastly, you’ve given the world of horror fiction one of its masterpieces, any chance we’ll ever see another H.B. Gregory novel? Perhaps a short story?
   HPG: As I’m almost 92 now; it’s unlikely.
   JP: On behalf of the readers of Inhuman I’d like to thank you for taking the time to for this interview and sharing some of the background concerning your remarkable book! Thanks again!
